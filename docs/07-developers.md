# Developers - Getting started

**Recommended versions of required software:**

- Node.js >= 8.15.1
- yarn >= 1.10.1

We recommend you to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and to run `nvm install` in the root followed by `nvm use` to get the right Node.js version, the `.mvrc` file in the root of your project is selecting for you the latest available node lts release.

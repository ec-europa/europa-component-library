Europa Component Library (ECL) provides a maximally un-opinionated set of components' behaviors. In rare occasions, some components such as the date picker might use external libraries which integrate typical behaviors. Components are jQuery-free and provide consistent APIs.

## How to use

First, you need to include the JavaScript file of `ECL.js` provided in the [latest release package](https://github.com/ec-europa/europa-component-library/releases). This file contains a JavaScript module called `ECL` which is an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) built by the [`ecl-builder` utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ec-europa/ecl-builder).

This means that when you include the `ECL` library in your pages, you will have a namespaced global called `ECL` which contains the components' factory functions.

### Instantiation

For a component to work on your pages, instantiate similarly to other popular JavaScript libraries. For example, here's how to use the dialog component:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    ECL.dialogs();
});
```

When you invoke the factory without any parameters, the dialog library will automatically create an overlay for the background and assume that you have a dialog window element on the page with an id `ecl-dialog` which will be displayed on click of a trigger element with `data-ecl-dialog` data attribute.

In other occasions, when you want to apply the dialog effect on existing elements which have different attributes, you can use the component as:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    ECL.dialogs({
      dialogWindowId: 'ecl-carousel'
    });
});
```

In this example, the dialog will again create the overlay for the background automatically, but this time it will pop up a carousel gallery as the body of the dialog when open.

### Components' settings

At the moment, components' JavaScript behaviors are documented in the code of the components themselves. When you want to see a demo of a component's instantiation and settings you can also view the "Context" tab in demos provided in the library.

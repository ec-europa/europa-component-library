# Conventions

ECL is a design system and a style guide for EC and EU implementations, design guidelines and language patterns. Being in such an important position, it integrates with several standards and applies multiple conventions in order to provide high consistency for ECL target audiences.

When working with ECL source code, the following tools are used to enforce standards: [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Details are available in the following sections:

- [Git commits](./git.md)
- [Linting](./linting.md)
- [Components](./components.md)
- [SCSS](./scss.md)
- [JavaScript](./javascript.md)

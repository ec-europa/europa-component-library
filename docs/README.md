# Documentation

ECL v2 consists of 2 systems (EC & EU) composed of more than 540 packages organized in 2 implementations within this repository - Vanilla and React. [Twig](https://github.com/ec-europa/ecl-twig) implementation is a separate project with nearly 60 packages in the 2 systems.

To maintain these it's important to have a good grasp of few concepts before diving in the code of the packages.

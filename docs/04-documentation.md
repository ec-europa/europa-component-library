This page explains how to update components documentation directly in GitHub

## Step 0: GitHub account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, make sure to create one and log on with it.

## Step 1: Open documentation file

- Go to [ECL repository](https://github.com/ec-europa/europa-component-library)
- Locate the component you wish to edit. Components are located in `framework/components`
- Open the README.md file in that component (example: `framework/components/ecl-blockquotes/README.md`)

## Step 2: Edit the documentation

- Click on the edit button (pencil icon on top right)
- Make any modification you wish by using markdown editor. Here is a [cheatsheet for markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- You can see result directly by switching to the "Preview" tab

## Step 3: Send your modifications

- Once you have modified the file, it should be sent to us. To do so, still on the edit page, scroll down to the "Commit changes" form
- Optionally, enter a description for your modifications.
- Make sure that the "Create a new branch" option is selected. You can keep default name for the branch.
- Click on "Propose file change". You are directed to a page to open a pull request.
- Just click on "Create pull request", no need to worry about the title or description.

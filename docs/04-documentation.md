title: How to update documentation on ECL
label: Edit documentation
---

This page explains how to update the documentation directly on GitHub.

## Prerequisite

If you don't already have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/login), make
sure to create one and log in with it.

You also have to be part of team
[ECL doc editors](https://github.com/orgs/ec-europa/teams/ecl-doc-editors/). For
an invite, please contact an owner of
[ec-europa](https://github.com/orgs/ec-europa/people?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=%20role%3Aowner).

## Step 1: Locate the file you want to update

Go to [ECL repository](https://github.com/ec-europa/europa-component-library)

### Option 1) Search

Make a search query and filter for `Markdown` type of files, which are the
documentation format.

![Locate ECL component in GitHub repository]({{ path
'/assets/screenshots/locate-ecl-component.gif' }})

</details>

### Option 2) Browsing the repository

<details><summary>_See how to do this step_</summary>

![Brose ECL GitHub repository to find a component]({{ path
'/assets/screenshots/locate-ecl-component-browsing.gif' }})

</details>

## Step 2: Create a new branch for your changes

In this step we will make a copy of the main version of the documentaiton in a
temporary branch which helps us in the process of updates and reviews.

Name the branch `docs/update-{component-name}-{ticket-number}`, i.e.
`docs/update-footer-INNO-123` or `docs/update-footer-noissue` if there is no
Jira ticket corresponding to the update.

![Create a new branch for documentation u* pdates]({{ path
'/assets/screenshots/create-new-branch.gif' }})

</details>

## Step 3: Open documentation file for editing

Ensure that you have switched to your new branch which is a good place to
suggest changes. Then click on the button to open the README.md file in that
component (example: `framework/components/ecl-footers/README.md`)

![Edit documentaiton file]({{ path
'/assets/screenshots/edit-documentation-file.gif' }})

</details>

## Step 4: Edit the documentation

* Make any modification you wish by using the markdown editor. Here is a
  [cheatsheet for markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

* You can see the result directly by switching to the "Preview" tab

<details><summary>_See how to do this step_</summary>

![Preview changes]({{ path '/assets/screenshots/edit-preview-changes.gif' }})

</details>

## Step 5: Save updates to the branch

* After you have modified the file, you have to commit the changes to save them
  in your branch.

* Enter title and description based on
  [naming conventions](https://ec-europa.github.io/europa-component-library/docs/conventions/git).

* Click on "Commit directly to the
  `docs/update-{component-name}-{ticket-number}`".

* This will save changes on your branch.

![Save changes to branch]({{ path
'/assets/screenshots/save-changes-on-branch.gif' }})

</details>

## Step 6: Open a pull request

* Once you made sure you have saved changes on your particular branch, you are
  ready to proceed on proposing these changes to the main `master` branch which
  is where you see the documentation in production.

* You can simply use the hints which GitHub gives you when you go to the root of
  the repo after saving your changes.

* Do not forget to add `tag: documentation` on your pull request which is used
  for the release log.

![Open a pull request]({{ path '/assets/screenshots/open-pull-request.gif' }})

</details>

## Step 7: Preview your changes and follow-up

* When the pull request is open, our `HAL-Patch-INNO` bot will show you a
  preview of the ECL style guide with the updates provided by you.

* You can review them and make further changes on the branch repeating steps
  1-5. Once the changes are saved, the pull request is automatically updated, no
  need to open another pull request.

* Changes on the pull request update the preview automatically.

<details><summary>_See how to do this step_</summary>

![Preview changes]({{ path '/assets/screenshots/preview-changes.gif' }})

</details>

## It's done!

Your pull request will be briefly reviewed by our team, so that there are no
linting issues and if all checks are green, changes will be integrated with the
master ECL branch in short time.

Thank you!

### Note: writing convention

We are using writing conventions for both
[pull requests](https://ec-europa.github.io/europa-component-library/docs/conventions/git)
and
[markdown](https://ec-europa.github.io/europa-component-library/docs/conventions/markdown).
You can optionally apply these conventions to facilitate documentation update
process.

In any case, we will have to apply the conventions on our side before publishing
it (so the content may be slightly modified).

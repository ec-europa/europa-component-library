# Developers - Getting started

**Recommended versions of required software:**

- Node.js = 18.18.2
- yarn >= 1.10.1

We recommend you to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and to run `nvm install` in the root followed by `nvm use` to get the right Node.js version, the `.mvrc` file in the root of your project is selecting for you the latest available node lts release.

## Setup

```bash
yarn
```

This will install all the external dependencies and then links the local dependencies together after running the prepublish script if available.

## Develop

**EC system:**

```bash
yarn start:ec
```

**EU system:**

```bash
yarn start:eu
```

Both `start:(ec|eu)` commands will spawn instances of Storybook development environments. These environments watch for changes in components of preview pane as well as changes in SCSS/CSS and/or JavaScript assets part of "vanilla" packages, rebuilding the relevant resources and reloading the browser when done.

**Website:**

```bash
yarn start:website
```

## Lint

```bash
yarn lint
```

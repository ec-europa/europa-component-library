# Filters

## When and how to use

When a list or collection of content items with shared characteristics is too large, filters allow users to narrow the scope of the displayed items.

- the filter has a H3 title and consists of input fields (with labels) and a 'clear all' action button
- all filter only allow for single select. This means that per search, only 1 value can be selected
- the first filter should always be a search field labeled Keywords
- always use a vertical, 1 column layout
- selecting a value in an input field automatically refreshes the list of displayed items

# Feedback messages

Users receive feedback, in the form of a message, about an input. Messages can be either positive (indicating that the form was submitted successfully) or negative (“The number you’ve provided is incorrect”).

## When to use

Use messages components to give feedback to users.

When validating a page, show one error notification on the top of the page which states "Some required information is missing or incomplete".

Then, for each input field with an error, show an error notification which states either "This is a required field" or "This is not a valid format".

Use success messages once the form has been submitted successfully, show a success notification.

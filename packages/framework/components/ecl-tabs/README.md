# Tabs

## Why and how to use this component

Tabs make it easy to explore and switch between different, often equally important, views or to browse categorized data sets.

## When to use this component

- when there are multiple sets of information that need to be shown in the same area
- when quick navigation between views is needed, while the rest of the page stays the same
- use tabs sparingly though. Often in-page navigation can be used instead

## Do not use this component

- in small viewports and some languages long tab labels make very difficult or almost impossible to use tabs
- if tab labels start getting long, it's an indication that tabs are probably not the right way to present the content don't use more than 3 tabs

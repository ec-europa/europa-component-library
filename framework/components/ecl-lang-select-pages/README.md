# Language selector | Page level

## Why and how to use this component

The language selector offers the alternative language versions of the page's main content.

The current language is indicated and the user can easily select a different language. It appears below the breadcrumb and above the page header.

## When to use this component

- on every page for which the userâ€™s preferred language is not available

## Do not use this component

- if the site is only in one language, the language selector must not be implemented at the page level
- if the site is translated, implementation of the corporate language selector is optional (in case of technical complexity)

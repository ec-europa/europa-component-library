# Buttons

## Why and how to use this component

Use buttons to indicate actions a user can take.

To make a clear distinction between multiple actions, you have to use different visual weight for buttons.
The button with the strongest visual weight will get more attention.

We've created multiple variants of the button to suit different situations:

| Button type | Usage | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Call-to-action button | Use these buttons sparingly on the most important actions like "Apply for funding" or "Watch live streaming".	| The EC yellow is used for call to actions buttons. Yellow is the most luminous of all the colours of the spectrum. It’s the colour that captures our attention more than any other colour. The yellow reinforces the attention and allows us to guide our users through the interface. |
| Primary button | Used for primary actions in case of forms, to initiate a search query, to apply a filter. | The EC Blue is used for primary buttons and is the default colour of the pages. It is a saturated colour, which makes it fitted for adding visual weight. |
| Secondary button | Used for secondary actions to cancel a form. | Secondary actions should have the weakest visual weight comparing to primary actions. |
| Default button | The default button is used for important links on the page. | White and EC blue is used for the default button. A secondary action isn’t as important as a primary action so it shouldn’t call as much attention. |
| Submit & abort options | The submit and abort buttons are used to confirm a choice or send information. The abort button ('cancel') is optional. | See Primary button + Secondary button. |
| Button block | The button block is a series of default buttons with a fixed width. They link to child pages. | See Default button style. |

## Primary and call-to-action button

Yellow is the most luminous of all the colours of the spectrum. It’s the color that captures our attention more than any other color. The yellow reinforce the attention and allows us to guide ours users through the interface.

### When should this be used?

The yellow primary button is used for call to actions and primary child links for an entity. Within each functional component, there can only be 3 primary buttons.

### Example

* The current colour of the Primary button is yellow not blue.

## Submit & abort buttons

The submit and abort buttons are used to confirm a choice or send information. The abort button ('cancel') is optional.

## Button block

The button block is a series of button links with a fixed width. They link to child pages or in a broader sense, logical outward paths from the current page.

### Example

https://beta.ec.europa.eu/about-european-union/about-european-commission_en

* We are currently working on this type of button group.

## External versus internal links

Links to addresses outside the ec.europa.eu domain are appended with an icon.

### When should this be used?

External link icon always accompanies an external link, also in buttons, in the menu, in a dropdown, etc.

## In-line text links

Styling of in-line links in paragraphs.

## Stand-alone links

These links are usually in a list. Because they are not part of a paragraph, they are not underlined.

## Inverted links

Inverted links are links that are shown on a dark background. They are always white and underlined. Except for the breadcrumb.

### When should this be used?
On dark backgrounds. For example the blue page header.

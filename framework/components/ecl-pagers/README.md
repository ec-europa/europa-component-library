# Pager

## Why and how to use this component

A pager enables a user to navigate in a list divided into different pages in order to see additional results in that list.

## When to use this component

- to be used when the filter component is used and there are **more than 20 results** (i.e. 'Announcements')

## Do not use this component

- when it's useful to see all results (i.e. 'Departments', 'Policies') - in this case, show all results

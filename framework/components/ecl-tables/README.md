# Table responsive

## Why and how to use this component

Tables show data sets organized in columns and rows.

## When to use this component

- when there is a need to show tables that will be displayed across different devices.
- when you want to compare one set of values with another.
- you want to show how various parts comprise the whole.
- you want to understand trends over time for variable(s).
- you want to see which values deviate from the norm.
- you want to establish (or show) relationship between 2 (or more) variables.

## Structure

### Headers

In-page data tables always contain a header **row**, a header **column** or **both**, that lists column titles. **(required)**

#### Web writing guidelines

- row/column titles should be kept short and clear.
- table headers should never be empty. This is particularly of concern for the top-left cell of some tables.

#### Accessibility guidelines

- the scope attribute identifies whether a table header is a column header or a row header.
- the thread element defines the header rows for tables.

### Rows and columns

The sets of raw data are displayed in rows below the header row.

If there are 5 rows or more, the rows have alternating colours (zebra stripes).

## Do not use this component

- don't use data tables to structure content that isn't part of a data set

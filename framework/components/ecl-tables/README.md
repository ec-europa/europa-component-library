# Table responsive

Tables are designed to handle different size of screens.
On small screen, display switches to a list, to prevent overflow.

Two display are also provided, depending on presence of table header or not.

To use these enhanced tables, add class **ecl-table** to table tag and call javascript function **eclTables()** (once on the page).

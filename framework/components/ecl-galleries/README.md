# Galleries

## When and how to use this component

This component helps the user to quickly browse available media thumbnails (images, videos and audio clips) related to the page's textual content.
These thumbnails display a caption describing the media item along with a visual icon to distinguish between video clips, audio clips and images.
It should always be used with the Gallery overlay component, which allows the user to visualize the media in a bigger size and access additional controls for video and audio playback. (The Gallery overlay component needs to be enabled).

## When to use this component

- When I want to have a gallery with different media in order to provide the user with more information about a certain topic, complement existing information.
- In events pages.
- When a gallery of images is, in general, needed.

## Do not use this component

- Without the Gallery overlay component

# Language selector | Site level

## Why and how to use this component

The language selector allows users to switch from one language to another.

By clicking on the language selector, a list of available languages is displayed. The user can then select the language of their choice (splash page).

If the site is only in one language, the corporate language selector must be implemented, but without any link (only indicating the current language).

## When to use this component

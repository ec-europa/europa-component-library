# Nav tabs

Tabs make it easy to explore and switch between different, often equally important, views or to browse categorized data sets.

## When should this be used?

When there are multiple differents sets of information need to be shown in the same area. Typically in case the information in one tab is an alternative to the other, so users do not need to switch tabs all the time to compile the information they need. Tabs are also recommended when quick navigation between views is needed, while the rest of the page stays the same.

Use tabs sparingly though. Often in-page navigation can be used instead.

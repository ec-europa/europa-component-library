# Notifications

A global notification is used to share important information with visitors that is applies to the entire site. Currently it doesn't have a 'close' option, but in some cases this could be useful.

It appears above the site header and is a stable element throughout the entire site.

## Implementation

http://ecfpfisdev.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/all/themes/europa/styleguide/assets/section-notification.html

## When should this be used?

When the site is in 'beta' state. In that case the notification is needed because it provides context and awareness about being on a beta environment. And by this manage the users' expectations and also provide a means to navigate to the live site.

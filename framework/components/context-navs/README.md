# Contextual Navigations

Allow users to navigate and explore the context of the information on the current page. Context navigation is placed:
- near the top of the page, below the title. It is placed there in case the context is crucial to interpret the page content.
- near the bottom of the page. That way it serves as a next step, for example as a next step to other content within the same context.

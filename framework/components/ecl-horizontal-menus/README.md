# Horizontal menus

## Introduction

The horizontal menu is used to display the first 2 levels of pages within a website's architecture.
For levels 3 and beyond the menu should be complemented by using navigational pages to drill
down to sub-pages.

The decision of implementing an horizontal menu instead of a vertical one is related to the fact that
the space it would occupy is already reserved to display in-page navigation on content pages and
filters on list pages.

## Usage Guidelines

### Number of Items

Due to limited horizontal space, especially on low resolution screens, we suggest that the number
of items on the first level of the menu be somewhere between 3-5.

### Labels

Labels on the first level of the menu should be simple and straightforward and optimally composed
of between 1 to 3 words (for the English language version).

Using 3 words should be an exception when you want to refer to two related topics and (e.g. News
and events / Contracts and funding)

### Drop down Arrows

The dropdown arrows visible next to each item that has sub-items provide the user with an
immediate visual indication that more items are available on hover/click.

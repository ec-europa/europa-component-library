# Language select (Site)

## Why and how to use this component

The language selector allows user to switch from one language to another one.

By clicking on the language selector, a list of available languages are displayed. The user can then select the language of his choice (splash page).

## When to use this component

- On the site header

## When not to use this component

- If the site is only in one language, the corporate language selector must be implemented, but without any link just indicating the current language.

# Timelines

A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order.

There are two variants of this component:
- Timeline: for bigger time ranges
- Time schedule: more granular, for hours (used on event)

## Timeline

There is an expand functionality. Once the timeline is expanded, it cannot be collapsed anymore.

- Collapsed (default)
- Expanded

The JS behaviour of this component needs to be rewritten without jQuery.

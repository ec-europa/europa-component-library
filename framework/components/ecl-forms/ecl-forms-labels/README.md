# Labels

Labels inform the user about the type of information that should be typed or selected in a form element.

## Why and how to use this component

These are labels that tell users what the corresponding input fields mean, they can be composed of a main "label" and a "help block" element

- label
- help block

## When to use

In every form element.

## Do not use this component

With left aligned labels. Top aligned labels also translate well on mobile

## Avoid

- labels written in all caps - they are more difficult to read and scan
- using placeholder text as labels
- placing check boxes side by side - check boxes underneath each other allows easy scanning
- using optional fields in forms - if you use them, you should clearly distinguish which fields are mandatory \* from those that are optional. The convention is to use an asterisk (\*) next to the required fields' labels and to display the message "Fields marked with an asterisk (\*) are required." on the top of the page
- hiding basic helper text

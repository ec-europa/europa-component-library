# Site header

## Why and how to use this component

The site header conveys the EC brand to the users and provides basic structure and guidance. It informs users about which site they are on and their current location in the site. It also provides users with context on the page they're viewing and the site search and language switcher options.

### Guidance*

The mute European Commission logo is a variation which was developed to allow multilingual purpose.

The use of the logo must be included in all European Commission website pages except for the homepage (**Commission and its priorities** and **Policies, information and services**)

The logo includes a link to the homepage of the **Policies, information and services** website.

| Components | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Breadcrumb | For the breadcrumb of improved sites DGs are asked to include the term 'European Commission', followed by the class, followed by the optional architecture levels, followed by the name of the site (site identification). |
| Site Identification | The site title can be implemented in the Header. It is an optional item, and is only recommended if the site has a strong specific branding. It is also recommended that DGS avoid duplication of the site identification, by removing the site identification above the page title. |
| Meta items | The Meta component is used for displaying meta information in single pages and listings to provide context to the page. |
| Page Title | The page title is a key page element. It gives the user context so they know they are looking at the right content. It provides a meaningful title for accessibility and search engine optimisation (SEO) purposes. The page title also functions as the top level heading (H1) in the site's page structure |
| Page introduction | A page description is a short sentence under the page title that describes what users can expect to find on the page. The description should be no longer than 3 lines. The page description is mandatory, but in exceptional circumstances, such as a page that contains only navigational links or a very limited amount of text, the page description can be omitted. It is important that the page description is as accurate as possible, as users often arrive on a page via a search engine or a link, and will therefore not have the context provided through normal site navigation. Users should not have to navigate backwards or forwards in the architecture to understand what the page is about. |

# Social icons

This is the ECL package you need when you want to implement a social media icon in any way.

Few possibilities to do so:

- As a link:

```html
<a href="#" class="ecl-link ecl-icon-social ecl-icon-social--facebook">Facebook</a>
```
Note that the `ecl-link` class is an optional extension you can have for links formatting.

- As a span:

```html
<span class="ecl-icon-social ecl-icon-social--facebook">Facebook</span>
```

- Making an icon smaller:

```html
  <span class="ecl-icon-social ecl-icon-social--smaller ecl-icon-social--facebook">Facebook</span>
```

# Inpage navigations

In-page navigation is a sticky element that provides in-page (or anchor) links to all H2 headings on that page. It helps users to orient themselves on the page and allows them to jump directly to content that is lower on the page, without scrolling first through the rest of the page content. A page with in-page links to content also make it easier to refer to that specific content when shared.

## Implementation

http://ecfpfisdev.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/all/themes/europa/styleguide/assets/section-inpagenav.html

## When should this be used?

The in-page navigation component should be used on pages with extensive body text that is clearly structured. Note that the page’s first columns are sacrificed to the in-page navigation.

## Example
http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/president_en#role

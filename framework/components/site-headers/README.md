# Site header

Site header is the site branding. It provides a mechanism to navigate to the homepage, gives access to site-wide tools such as search and the language selector and offers a way into the site-wide task classification and topics menu.

## New version in the make
This component is currently being reworked. Version 2 will be released soon and look like this:

| Mandatory elements |
|---|
| Mute European C logo |
| Language selector |
| Search bar |

## Implementation

http://ecfpfisdev.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/all/themes/europa/styleguide/assets/section-siteheader.html

## When should this be used?

Every page of every Commission website.

## Example

http://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu_en

## Design rationale
On desktop, a left aligned logo performs better than a centred logo.

## Why and how to use this component

Apart from conveying the EC brand to the users, the header provides basic structure and guidance: it informs users the site they're on, their current location in the site and context on the page they're viewing. It also provides users with utility navigation such as site search and language switcher.

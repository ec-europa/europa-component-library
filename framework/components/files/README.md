# Files

## File (download)

The download asset component is used to download a file: pdf, txt, jpg, zip... is used to display files on a publication detail page. The 'language functionality' is an expandable link 'all languages'. It is only available in case a file is available in multiple languages. Clicking it reveals some 'language version blocks', one for each language the file is available in.

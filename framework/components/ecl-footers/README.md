# Footers

## Why and how to use this component

The footer offers access to copyright information, disclaimer and terms of use, privacy and cookies policy. It allows the user to navigate to corporate social media profiles.

### Corporate footer

- information about the European Commission and European Union: links to easily navigate between the Political/Information sites
- information on how to connect to social platforms of the European Commission
- external links to European Union sites
- about the Commission's new web presence
- resources for partners
- cookies
- legal notice: a text area notifying the end user of legal information with an inline link for more information
- contact

### Custom footer (non mandatory)

In exceptional circumstances, a custom footer can be added.

A custom footer should be used only if the corporate footer does not satisfy all the page's requirements.

There can be no overlap with other links in the corporate footer.

- identification of the site name
- information on how to connect to social platforms of the improved site
- contact
- other relevant information

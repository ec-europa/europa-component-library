# Links

Different kind of links are available, depending on the context:
- In-line links (**.ecl-link**): when links are inside paragraphs.
- External links (**.ecl-link--external**): when links pointed outside the ec.europa.eu domain.
- Stand-alone links (**.ecl-link--standalone**): When links are not part of a paragraph. These links are usually in a list.
- Inverted links (**.ecl-link--inverted**): When links are shown on a dark background.
- Expandable link (**.ecl-link--expand**): When information needs to hide or expand to show additional content.
- 'View all' links (**.ecl-link--all**): When more items need to be displayed. This link is always placed at the bottom of a list of items. The 'view all' link leads to the full list.

# Font

## Font family

Arial is the standard typeface we use. We chose Arial because it is a system font that is suited for multilingual use.

## Font style

### Regular

This is the default font weight we use for text.

### Bold or 600

The bold font weight is used to put emphasis on important words and to add visual emphasis on headings.

### Italic

We use italic for quotes

### Underline

We use underline to indicate text is clickable. This is not needed in buttons or in other components that are clearly clickable by nature.

## Font size

| XXL | XL | L | M | S | XS | XXS |

| 40px - 2.22em | 30px - 1.67em | 22px - 1.22em | 18px - 1.00em | 16px - 0.89em | 14px - 0.78em | 12px - 0.67em |

## Font color

Give attention to the contrast if you give a background colour to text.

WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) ensure that content is accessible by everyone, regardless of disability or user device. To meet these standards, text and interactive elements should have a color contrast ratio of at least WCAG 2 AA Compliant (18pt+). This ensures that viewers who cannot see the full color spectrum are able to read the text. The options below offer color palette combinations that fall within the range of Section 508 compliant foreground/background color contrast ratios. To ensure that text remains accessible, use only these permitted color combinations.

There are a number of online colour contrast checkers.

We recommend using only following font colours:

| Black | EC Dark Grey | EC Blue | White |
|---|---|---|---|
| #000000 | #404040 | #004494 | #ffffff |
| Headers H1, H2 | Headers H3,H4 / Default font color | For text links | On blue backgrounds |

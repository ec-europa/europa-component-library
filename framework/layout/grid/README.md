# ECL Grid

A grid provides a structure of rows and columns for aligning content. Grids are useful because they help create a familiar and easily navigable structure for content.

Please consider using [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) before jumping into grids when you are looking for solutions for component-specific layout management,

ECL uses the Bootstrap 4 grid system in order to facilitate the adoption, and try to increase developers' productivity. Thus, the grid is based on the widely-known 12 columns, it's responsive, and provides great flexibility in terms of implementation. Refer to [Bootstrap documentation](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/) for understanding the general concepts.

When using the grid of ECL, use `.ecl-` namespace in front of Bootstrap's classes in order to avoid collisions.

# ECL Grid

Use a grid to give your design a basic underlying structure. By placing your design elements on the invisible lines of a grid, you will create a more structured and coherent composition.

Please consider using [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) before jumping into grids when you are looking for solutions for component-specific layout management,

ECL uses the Bootstrap 4 grid system in order to facilitate the adoption, and try to increase developers' productivity. Thus, the grid is based on the widely-known 12 columns, it's responsive, and provides great flexibility in terms of implementation. Refer to [Bootstrap documentation](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/) for understanding the general concepts.

When using the grid of ECL, use `.ecl-` namespace in front of Bootstrap's classes in order to avoid collisions.

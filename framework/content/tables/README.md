# Table responsive

Tables show tabular data in columns and rows.Tables provide precision where visuals do not.

## When should this be used?

- When you want to compare one set of values with another.
- You want to show how various parts comprise the whole.
- You want to understand trends over time for variable(s).
- You want to see which values deviate from the norm.
- You want to establish (or show) relationship between 2 (or more) variables.

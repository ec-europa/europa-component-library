# Colors

Colors available in ECL

The primary colors are blue ($ecl-primary), yellow ($ecl-secondary) and grey ($ecl-shade).
Only use colors to highlight important content or actions. Use sparingly.

- **blue**: Used for navigational elements like links and buttons, but also as a background color (page header) to give the page more contrast.
- **yellow**: Used in elements to get attention, primary buttons, call-to-action buttons and focus states. Is used only as a background color in buttons never as a text color. Use sparingly.
- **grey**: Grey is used for static text, soft backgrounds and dividers. We provide a grey color palette.

Notification colors should be used as follow:
- $ecl-info: for informative messages
- $ecl-warning: for warnings
- $ecl-success: for success messages
- $ecl-error: for errors

# Images

Images should be responsive by default.

We use the following (opinionated) CSS rule on all `img` elements:

```css
img {
  height: auto;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

Pro tip: [use `<picture>` and srcset](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/)

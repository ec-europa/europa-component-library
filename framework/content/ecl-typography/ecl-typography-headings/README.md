# Headings

Headings and subheadings should be organised in a hierarchy, with heading first,
followed by subheadings in order (An H2 will nestle under H1, and H2 under H3,
and so on down).

|           | Size | Leading | Weight              | Colour      | Usage                                           |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Headline  | M    | 40px    | Bold / regular      | White       | Headline on Page header (only used on homepage) |
| Heading 1 | XXL  | 44px    | 600                 | White/Black | Page titles (page header)/body of text          |
| Heading 2 | XL   | 33px    | 600                 | Black       | Body of the page                                |
| Heading 3 | L    | 24px    | 600                 | EC Grey     | Body of the page/Listing components             |
| Heading 4 | M    | 30px    | 600                 | EC Grey     |                                                 |
| Heading 5 | S    | 22px    | Regular / uppercase | EC Grey     |                                                 |

## Line height

Line-height, traditionally known as leading, is one of several factors that
directly contribute to readability and pacing of copy. Line-heights are based on
the size of the font itself. Ideal line-heights for standard copy has a ratio of
1.66. For example, a type at 1em/16px would have a line-height of 24px (16 x
1.66). The exception to this rule are headings, which need less spacing and
therefore have a line-height ratio of 1.1.

**Headings line-height**: type size x 1.1

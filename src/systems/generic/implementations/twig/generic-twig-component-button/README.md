# Buttons

## Why and how to use this component

Use buttons to indicate actions a user can take.

To make a clear distinction between multiple actions, you have to use different
visual weight for buttons.

The button with the strongest visual weight will attract the most attention.

We've created multiple variants of the button to suit the following situations:

### Default button

#### Usage

The default button is used for important links on the page.

#### Style

White and EC blue is used for the default button. A secondary action isn’t as
important as a primary action so it shouldn’t call as much attention.

### Primary button

#### Usage

Used for primary actions in case of forms, to initiate a search query, to apply
a filter.

#### Style

The EC Blue is used for primary buttons and is the default colour of the pages.
It is a saturated colour, which makes it fitted for adding visual weight.

### Secondary button

#### Usage

Used for secondary actions to cancel a form.

#### Style

Secondary actions should have the weakest visual weight comparing to primary
actions.

### Call-to-action button

#### Usage

Use these buttons sparingly on the most important actions like "Apply for
funding" or "Watch live streaming".

#### Style

The EC yellow is used for call to actions buttons. Yellow is the most luminous
of all the colours of the spectrum. It’s the colour that captures our attention
more than any other colour.

The yellow reinforces the attention and allows us to guide our users through the
interface.

### Submit & abort options

#### Usage

The submit and abort buttons are used to confirm a choice or send information.
The abort button ('cancel') is optional.

#### Style

See Primary button + Secondary button.

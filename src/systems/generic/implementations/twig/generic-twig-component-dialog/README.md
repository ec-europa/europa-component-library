# Dialogs

A dialog is an application window that is designed to interrupt the current
processing of an application in order to prompt the user to enter information or
require a response.

## Normal dialog (default)

Default implementation of the dialog. Will display an horizontally and vertically centered
container with the text. When pressed, a top-right dismiss button will remove the container and its transparent overlay. The small container goes fullscreen for screens smaller than 480px.

## Wide dialog

Contrary to the normal dialog, when shown this variant of the dialog will always fill the entire screen no matter the user's screen size

# Navigation menus

## When and how to use this component

The horizontal menu is used to display the first 2 levels of pages within a
website's architecture.

For levels 3 and below the menu should be complemented by using navigation
blocks to drill down to sub-pages.

## Guidelines

### Amount of Items

Due to limited horizontal space, especially on low resolution screens, the
number of items on the first level of the menu should be 3-5 items.

### Labeling

Labels on the first level of the menu should be simple and composed of 1 to 3
words (for the English language version of the menu).

Using 3 words should be an exception when you want to refer to two related
topics (e.g. News and events / Contracts and funding).

## When to use this component

- if you need an alternative to the listing navigation blocks
- only for improved sites
- only with a basic page header
- below the basic page header
- on every page of the website

## Do not use this component

- with a default page header

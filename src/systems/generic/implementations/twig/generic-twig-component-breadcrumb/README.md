# Breadcrumb

## Why and how to use this component

Users need a way to see a page's location in the site hierarchy. They also need a way to navigate to higher levels in the site architecture.

The breadcrumb - included on every page except the homepage itself - provides the user with a 'sense of place' and a relationship to the site's hierarchy and structure. This is particularly useful for a user who has arrived at a page directly through a link, bookmark/favourite or a search engine

### General

- breadcrumbs start on the highest level of the site with the label "Home" to reduce the length of the breadcrumb
- short titles can be used to create a shorter version of the title which will be displayed only in the breadcrumb and not in the headline
- the links in the breadcrumb must point to pages in the same language as the current page
- clicking an item in the breadcrumb directs the user to that level in the hierarchy above the current page
- the title of the current page is displayed on the last element of the breadcrumb
- the last element of the breadcrumb will have a slightly different style to indicate users that it's not a clickable element
- labels should provide continuity to the website. This is done by ensuring each tab label is styled the same
- each label is parted with a separating character
- the separating characters and the spaces between the links and the labels are not linked

## When to use this component

- breadcrumbs are required and should appear in the page header on every page of the site (except on the homepage of European Commission's political and information sites)

## Do not use this component

- if there is no second level to show

# Display utility

[Forked from Bootstrap 4 Beta](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/display/)
and adapted to our needs.

## Common `display` values

The
[`display` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)
accepts a handful of values and we support many of them with utility classes. We
purposefully don't provide every value as a utility, so here's what we support:

- `.ecl-u-d-none`
- `.ecl-u-d-inline`
- `.ecl-u-d-inline-block`
- `.ecl-u-d-block`
- `.ecl-u-d-table`
- `.ecl-u-d-table-cell`
- `.ecl-u-d-flex`
- `.ecl-u-d-inline-flex`

Put them to use by applying any of the classes to an element of your choice. For
example, here's how you could use the inline, block, or inline-block utilities
(the same applies to the other classes).

Responsive variations also exist for every single utility mentioned above.

- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-none`
- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-inline`
- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-inline-block`
- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-block`
- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-table`
- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-table-cell`
- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-flex`
- `.ecl-u-d-[ sm|md|lg|xl ]-inline-flex`

# Breadcrumb

The breadcrumb provides the user with a 'sense of place' and a relationship to the site's hierarchy and structure.

This is particularly useful for a user who has arrived at a page directly through a link, bookmark/favourite or a search engine Usage.

Users need a way to see a page's location in the site hierarchy. They also need a way to navigate to higher levels in the site architecture.

## Usage

Clicking an item in the breadcrumb directs the user to that level in the hierarchy above the current page.

### When to use

* breadcrumbs are required on every page of the site and should appear in the page header (except on the homepage of European Commission's political and information sites)

### When to consider something else

* if there is no second level to show

### Guidance

* breadcrumbs start on the highest level of the site
* the links in the breadcrumb must point to pages in the same language as the current page
* clicking an item in the breadcrumb directs the user to that level in the hierarchy above the current page
* **the title of the current page is shown in the breadcrumb - the last element won't be clickable and it will have a different styling (e. g. bold) to indicate its prominence in the navigation path**
* labels should provide continuity to the website. This is done by ensuring each tab label is styled the same
* each label is parted with a separating character
* the separating characters and the spaces between the links and the labels are not linked

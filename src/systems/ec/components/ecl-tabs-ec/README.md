# Tabs

## Why and how to use this component

Tabs make it easy to explore and switch between different, often equally
important, views or to browse categorized data sets.

## When to use this component

* when there are multiple sets of information that need to be shown in the same
  area
* when quick navigation between views is needed, while the rest of the page
  stays the same
* use tabs sparingly though. Often in-page navigation can be used instead

## Do not use this component

* in small viewports and some languages long tab labels make very difficult or
  almost impossible to use tabs
* if tab labels start getting long, it's an indication that tabs are probably
  not the right way to present the content don't use more than 3 tabs

Templates provide users examples of components being used together on a page. They can help users to visualize their project, in order to address their needs.

Templates here are built with pure HTML/CSS. The layouts are flexible, based on your needs, except the site header and footer. Uers can pick and choose the components that deliver their messages to their audience.

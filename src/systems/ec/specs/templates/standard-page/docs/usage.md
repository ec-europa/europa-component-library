Templates provide users with examples of how components can be used together on a page. They can help users display their project and understand how its layout can best meet their needs.

The templates we use are built using HTML/CSS only. The layouts are flexible, to take account of your needs; the only exceptions are the site header and footer, which are standardised. Users can choose those components that best convey the messages they want to send to their audience.

Templates allow you to quickly create web pages and websites that are in line with the European Commission's corporate guidelines.

Standard presentation ensures a "corporate image" for the Commission which provides a coherent look to the web presence. It also makes things easier for the user through

- standard elements with a consistent appearance and position on every page that provide the same functions throughout the site at all levels
- "vertical" and "horizontal" navigational aids (for example, between languages)

The standard template must be used for all new development and can also be introduced on existing pages to replace a previous template, but this should be done on a site basis, not page by page. 

The pages using this template must contain at least all the elements shown in the mandatory version. 

Mandatory components: Site header, page header, feedback form, and corporate footer.

The ECL Grid is a simplified version of the [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/).

The classes are prefixed with `.ecl-`, e.g. `.ecl-col-md-4`.

There's no `container-fluid`.

Moreover, `.ecl-col, .ecl-col-sm, ...` without the number of columns is not allowed. You have to **explicitly specify** the number of columns (out of 12).

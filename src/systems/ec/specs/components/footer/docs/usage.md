The footer appears at the bottom of all ec.europa.eu pages.

It is divided into 2 functional areas:

- the main content area
- the secondary content area

## Main content area

The main content area of the footer offers access to the two main parts of the site (the political and information sites), the corporate social media profiles and the other European Union institutions.

## Secondary content area

The secondary content area of the footer offers access to resources for partners, the cookie policy, the legal notice and contact information.

## Custom area

In exceptional circumstances, a custom are can be added if the main and secondary content areas do not satisfy the requirements.

A custom area can contain:

- identification of the site name
- information on connecting to social platforms
- contact information
- other relevant information, such as a link to the site map

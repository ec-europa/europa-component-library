The footer appears at the bottom of all ec.europa.eu pages.

## Corporate footer

It is divided into 2 functional areas:

- the main content area
- the secondary content area

Main content area

The main content area of the footer offers access to the two main parts of the site (the political and information sites), the corporate social media profiles and the other European Union institutions.
Secondary content area

The secondary content area of the footer offers access to resources for partners, the privacy policy, the cookie policy, the legal notice and contact information.

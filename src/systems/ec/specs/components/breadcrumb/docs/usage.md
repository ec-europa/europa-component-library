The breadcrumb helps users see their current location in relation to the rest of the website and allows them to navigate to higher levels. The breadcrumb is particularly useful for users who arrive on a page directly via a link, a bookmark/favourite or a search engine.

Breadcrumbs are created automatically when publishing a new page. The page title will then appear in the breadcrumb, indicating its place in the hierarchical structure of the site.

## When to use

Breadcrumbs are required and should appear in the page header on every page of the site (except on the homepage of European Commissionâ€™s website).

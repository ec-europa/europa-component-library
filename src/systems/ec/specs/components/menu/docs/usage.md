The menu component is a horizontal bar that offers a list of links for a website's information architecture. The menu component can be one-level or two levels deep and appears just below the header.

## When to use this component

- As part of the header, just below the basic page header
- If you need an alternative to the navigation list groups

## When not to use this component

The menu can only be combined with a basic page header type. Do not use this component with any of the other header types.

## Guidelines

- Use the menu to display the first 2 page levels within a website's architecture - use navigation list groups for level 3 and below
- Due to limited horizontal space, especially on low resolution screens, the number of items on the first level of the menu should be limited to 3-5 items
- Labels on the first level of the menu should be no more than 3 words (for the English language version)

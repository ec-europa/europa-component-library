# Site switcher

## Why and how to use this component

Users need a way to easily navigate between the European Commission's two sites;
'Commission and its priorities' and 'Policies, information and services'. The
solution is a site switcher - two prominent buttons that allow for navigation
between the homepages of the two sites.

## When to use this component

- on every page of every Commission website.

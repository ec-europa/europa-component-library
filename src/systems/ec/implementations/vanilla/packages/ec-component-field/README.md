# Fields

The field component is used to display structured information. It consists of
sets of labels in the left column and their corresponding values in the right
column.

## When to use this component

* to display structured information like characteristics of a feedback, an
  event, contact information.
* to display information in list blocks used on filtered list pages

## Aligned fields

The field aligned modifier should be used for aligning fields that do not have a
label with fields that do have a label.

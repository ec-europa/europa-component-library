# Social icons

This is the ECL package you need when you want to implement a social media icon
in any way.

Few possibilities to do so:

* As a link:

```html
<a href="#" class="ecl-link ecl-social-icon ecl-social-icon--facebook">Facebook</a>
```

Note that the `ecl-link` class is an optional extension you can have for links
formatting.

* As a span:

```html
<span class="ecl-social-icon ecl-social-icon--facebook">Facebook</span>
```

* Making an icon smaller:

```html
  <span class="ecl-social-icon ecl-social-icon--smaller ecl-social-icon--facebook">Facebook</span>
```

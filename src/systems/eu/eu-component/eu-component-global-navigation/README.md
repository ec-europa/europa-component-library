# Global navigation

## What is it?

- Pre-defined branding notification banner + link to all institutions
- Benchmarking: Same principle used to identify [official US government websites](https://us.gov/)
- [Article by NNG group: Universal navigation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/universal-navigation/?lm=centered-logos&pt=article) (Sept 2016)

## Why?

- To improve the user experience: users recognize that they are on an official website of the European Union part of the EU family.
- Standard way for all sites under Europa.eu to link to Europa.eu and other institutions. Currently on each institution site the links to Europa.eu and other institutions is done differently on each site.
- When users navigate via Europa.eu to a site of another institution's site, they go out of the site and no easy way recognisable way to come back

# Gallery

## When and how to use this component

This component helps the user to quickly browse available media thumbnails
(images, videos and audio clips) related to the page's textual content. These
thumbnails display a caption describing the media item along with a visual icon
to distinguish between video clips, audio clips and images.

## When to use this component

- When I want to have a gallery with different media in order to provide the
  user with more information about a certain topic, complement existing
  information.
- In events pages.

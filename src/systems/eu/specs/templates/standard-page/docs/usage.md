Templates provide users with examples of how components can be used together on a page. They can help users display their project and understand how its layout can best meet their needs.

The templates we use are built using HTML/CSS only. The layouts are flexible, to take account of your needs; the only exceptions are the site header and footer, which are standardised. Users can choose those components that best convey the messages they want to send to their audience.

Europa.eu standard template is work in progress.

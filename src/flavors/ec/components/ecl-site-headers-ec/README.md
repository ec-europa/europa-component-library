### Guidance\*

The mute European Commission logo is a variation which was developed to allow
multilingual purpose.

The use of the logo must be included in all European Commission website pages
except for the homepage (**Commission and its priorities** and **Policies,
information and services**)

The logo includes a link to the homepage of the **Policies, information and
services** website.

# Breadcrumbs

## Why and how to use this component

Users need a way to see a page's location in the site hierarchy. They also need
a way to navigate to higher levels in the site architecture.

The breadcrumb - included on every page except the homepage itself - provides
the user with a 'sense of place' and a relationship to the site's hierarchy and
structure. This is particularly useful for a user who has arrived at a page
directly through a link, bookmark/favourite or a search engine

### General

* breadcrumbs start on the highest level of the site
* the links in the breadcrumb must point to pages in the same language as the
  current page
* clicking an item in the breadcrumb directs the user to that level in the
  hierarchy above the current page
* the title of the current page is not repeated in the breadcrumb
* labels should provide continuity to the website. This is done by ensuring each
  tab label is styled the same
* each label is parted with a separating character
* the separating characters and the spaces between the links and the labels are
  not linked

### When to use this component

* breadcrumbs are required and should appear in the page header on every page of
  the site (except on the homepage of European Commission's political and
  information sites)

### Do not use this component

* if there is no second level to show

# Filters

## When and how to use

When a list or collection of content items with shared characteristics is too
large, filters allow users to narrow the scope of the displayed items.

* the filter has a H3 title and consists of input fields (with labels) and a
  'clear all' action button
* all filter only allow for single select. This means that per search, only 1
  value can be selected
* the first filter should always be a search field labeled Keywords
* always use a vertical, 1 column layout
* selecting a value in an input field automatically refreshes the list of
  displayed items

# Messages

## Why and how to use this component

Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the available
flexible alert messages.\
These includes errors, warnings, and general updates. For each kind of warning we
use an icon and a specific colour.

## When to use this component

| Status      | Colour      | Usage                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Success     | EC Green N  | Forms / Page notification (bellow the page header)     |
| Informative | EC Blue N   | Forms / Page notification (bellow the page header)     |
| Warning     | EC Orange N | Forms / Page notification (bellow the page header)     |
| Error       | EC Red N    | Forms / Page notification (bellow the page header)     |
| Live stream | EC Orange N | Pages with livestream content (bellow the page header) |

## When not to use this component

* to include notifications that aren't related to the user's current goal
* but don't overdo it — too many notifications will either overwhelm or annoy
  the user and are likely to be ignored

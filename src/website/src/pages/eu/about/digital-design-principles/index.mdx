<Paragraph size="lead">
  The following digital design principles{' '}
  <strong>guide and influence our design decisions</strong> and serve as our
  solutions' foundation. They do not merely ensure consistency but they help us
  to <strong>convey the European Union vision and values</strong> while
  supporting the User Experience and they iteratively evolve as we make new
  findings.
</Paragraph>

## Connecting with people

<Paragraph>
  <strong>We design for people</strong>, because there's more to people than
  just interaction with technology. Through empathy, we create authentic
  connections with human beings, helping them with their digital journey and{' '}
  <strong>enabling happiness</strong>.
</Paragraph>

## Intuitive and straightforward

Design is like an ongoing two-way conversation. Familiarity and clarity enhance this conversation, making it <strong>effective, easy to understand</strong> and <strong>personal</strong>.

## Inspiring trust and engagement

Design helps to create branding and organisation trust. It conveys a positive sense of <strong>transparency, openness</strong> and <strong>modernity</strong>, and builds future engagement.

## Relevant, effective and concise

We promote <strong>quality over quantity</strong>. We deliver exactly what is needed to satisfy our visitors' expectations and enhance our credibility as an official and trusted source.

## Inclusive and accessible

Our design reflects the values of the European way of life, but without compromising the quality or aesthetic of the website.

## Long-lasting and evolving

We think outside the boundary of a website's homepage. We embrace <strong>social changes</strong> and <strong>future thinking</strong>, reframing problems and solutions beyond fashionable appeal.

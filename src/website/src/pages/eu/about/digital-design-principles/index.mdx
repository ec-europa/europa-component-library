  The following digital design principles{' '}
  <strong>guide and influence our design decisions</strong> and serve as our

## Connecting with people

**We design for people**, because there's more to people than just interaction with technology. Through empathy, we create authentic connections with human beings, helping them with their digital journey and **enabling happiness**.

## Intuitive and straightforward

Design is like an ongoing two-way conversation. Familiarity and clarity enhance this conversation, making it **effective, easy to understand** and **personal**.

## Inclusive and accessible

Our design reflects the values of the European way of life, but without compromising the quality or aesthetic of the website.

## Long-lasting and evolving

We think outside the boundary of a website's homepage. We embrace **social changes** and **future thinking**, reframing problems and solutions beyond fashionable appeal.

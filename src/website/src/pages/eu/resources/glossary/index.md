## Accessibility

Web accessibility is a set of design and development guidelines and regulations allowing users to see, understand and interact with web sites, no matter what technical resources are used, and no matter what age or disabilities they have. Web sites need to be designed and developed so that all users can access the information.

## Components

Components are elements necessary to build a website; think of components as building/Lego blocks in webpages. For example: buttons, lists, timeline.

## Content Type

In Drupal, a Content Type is a pre-defined collection of data types (Fields) which relate to each other by an informational context. In this sense, "context" means "parts that should be considered as a correlated whole."

## CMS

CMS stands for Content Management System. It provides capabilities for multiple users with different permission levels to manage (all or a section of) content, data or information of a website project, or internet / intranet application.
A CMS separates content from the design and functionality of the site, and it also makes it easier for content to be added to the site for users who aren’t developers or designers.

## Design System

A design system is a library of visual style and components designed, documented and released as reusable code for developers and designers. A design system also provides guidance on accessibility, page layout, styles, and branding.

## Mockup

Mockup it the final design of the website or application. However, it is usually neither interactive nor clickable. It demonstrates basic functionality, represent information structure, and visualize content in a static way. It allows people to review the visual aspect of the project.

## Page Layout

Page Layout is consisted of templates with components with real representative content in place.

## Prototype

Prototype is the last stage before design work begins. Designers use this opportunity to test their efforts, to discover problems during the flow of interaction and journey flow.

## Responsiveness

Responsive means that a web pages renders well and provides optimal viewing across devices and window or screen sizes.

## Templates

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure. Templates focus on the page’s underlying content structure rather than the page’s final content. Templates bring all the necessary page components functioning together.

## Wireframe

A wireframe is a simple visual scheme which represents a layout of a screen or page of a digital product such as a website or application. They are often compared to architectural blueprints since a wireframe is usually a monochromatic illustration which shows the structure of a screen. Also, designers can use bright marks or spots to outline specific areas or design elements. There are three types of wireframes: low-fidelity, medium-fidelity, and high-fidelity.

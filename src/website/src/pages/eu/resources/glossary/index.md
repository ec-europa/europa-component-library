## Accessibility

Web accessibility is a set of design and development guidelines used for designing websites. Making websites that are accessible to everyone is part of the European Commission Directive. For more information: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/web-accessibility

## Components

Components are reusable building blocks necessary to design a website. For example: breadcrumbs, buttons, lists, and paginations.

## Content Type

A content type is a reusable template in a Content Management System (CMS). It allows you to add content to their website in a structured and consistent way. Fields available in a given content type are defined according to what research and analysis have identified as commonly needed.

## Design System

A design system is a library of visual guidelines and reusable components for developers and designers to create websites.

## Mockup

It is a draft of the proposed web pages for visual reviews and adaptations. Usually there are more completed navigation concepts and possible layouts before the design is finalised.

## Prototype

Prototype is the last stage of the design showing all features, functionalities and visual styles. It is less costly if there are changes or updates required before the final design is implemented.

## Responsiveness

Responsiveness means that web pages can be scaled from handheld devices to desktop displays. It provides best user experiences across as many devices as possible.

## Templates

Templates are page layouts consist of components and underlying content structure. They are the basic structure to create cohesive designs.

## Wireframe

A wireframe is usually a low fidelity sketch of a concept at the early stage of website design process. Details of the design are not decided. It is one step before mockup is being created.

import { IconList } from '@ecl/website-components';

The icons are separated into four categories.

## Social media

These are icons of social media sites with one colour overlay. We use them in the footer.

<IconList set="branded" />

## General

This is the largest group. We use the icons in many components from accordion to list.

<IconList set="general" />

## Notifications

<IconList set="notifications" />

## UI

These icons are part of UI (like arrows or external icon for links).

<IconList set="ui" />

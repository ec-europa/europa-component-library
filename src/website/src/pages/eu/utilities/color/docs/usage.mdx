  Color utilities let you edit text and background colors of elements.
</Paragraph>

## Accessibility warning

When changing text or background color, make sure to always keep a high enough contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).

There are several online tools to check the contrast, for instance [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

## Text color

By using classes `ecl-u-color-*` you can set the color of the text.
Available colors are:

- The [blue palette](https://v2--europa-component-library.netlify.com/eu/guidelines/colours/)
- The [grey palette](https://v2--europa-component-library.netlify.com/eu/guidelines/colours/)
- Semantic colors (primary, seconday, shade)
- Notification colors (info, success, warning, error)
- Default colors (black-100, white-100)

Note that yellow colors are not available on purpose; text should not use the yellow palette.

## Background color

By using classes `ecl-u-bg-*` you can set the background color of an element.
Available colors are:

- `default` (white)
- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `shade`

<Paragraph size="lead">
  Typography utilities let you display text related elements like heading or
  paragraphs. It also allows you to change text display if needed (font size,
  colour, ...).
</Paragraph>

## Headings

Use classes `ecl-u-type-heading-1` to `ecl-u-type-heading-4` to apply headings styles.

See [typography guidelines](https://v2--europa-component-library.netlify.com/eu/guidelines/typography/) for more information.

## Paragraph

Use class `ecl-u-type-paragraph` on a `<p>` element to apply related styles.  
Several type of paragraphs are availables, depending on your needs.

See [typography guidelines](https://v2--europa-component-library.netlify.com/eu/guidelines/typography/) for more information.

## Text color

By using classes `ecl-u-type-colour-*` you can set the color of the text.
Available colors are:

- The [blue palette](https://v2--europa-component-library.netlify.com/eu/guidelines/colours/)
- The [grey palette](https://v2--europa-component-library.netlify.com/eu/guidelines/colours/)
- Semantic colors (primary, seconday, shade)
- Notification colors (info, success, warning, error)
- Default colors (black-100, white-100)

Note that yellow colors are not available on purpose; text should not use the yellow palette.

## Text styles

Several classes are available to alter text display (uppercase, underline, strike, ...).  
In most cases, styles included in components are enough, but you can use one of these classes in for specific cases.

See the showcase to have the list of classes.

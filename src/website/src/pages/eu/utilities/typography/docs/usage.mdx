<Paragraph size="lead">
  Typography utilities let you display text related elements like heading or
  paragraphs. It also allows you to change text display if needed (font size,
  colour, ...).
</Paragraph>

## Headings

Use classes `ecl-u-type-heading-1` to `ecl-u-type-heading-5` to apply headings styles.

See <Link to="/eu/guidelines/typography/">typography guidelines</Link> for more information.

## Paragraph

Use class `ecl-u-type-paragraph` on a `<p>` element to apply related styles.  
Several type of paragraphs are availables, depending on your needs.

See <Link to="/eu/guidelines/typography/">typography guidelines</Link> for more information.

## Text colour

By using classes `ecl-u-type-color-*` you can set the colour of the text.
Available colours are:

- primary colours (blue, yellow, grey)
- black and white
- the <Link to="/eu/guidelines/colours/">grey palette</Link>
- the <Link to="/eu/guidelines/colours/">blue palette</Link>
- the <Link to="/eu/guidelines/colours/">notification palette</Link>

Note that the yellow palette is not available for text colour; text should not be displayed in yellow.

**Accessibility warning**

When changing text colour, make sure to always keep a high enough contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).

There are several online tools to check the contrast, for instance [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

## Text styles

Several classes are available to alter text display (uppercase, underline, strike, ...).  
In most cases, styles included in components are enough, but you can use one of these classes in for specific cases.

See the showcase to have the list of classes.

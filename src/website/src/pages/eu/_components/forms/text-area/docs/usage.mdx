| Optional indicator | yes       | Indicator stating **if** input fields are **optional**. **All fields are mandatory by default - only ask for information that is required** |
| Error message      | yes       | A message informing the user **if** there is a problem with their entry                                                                     |

## Do's

- **minimise** the number of input fields - only ask for necessary information
- **arrange them vertically** to improve scannability and reduce errors
- **group** related fields together
- **order** input fields logically, matching real-world task succession and interactions
- always **label each text area** with a short, distinct and indicative title, **placed above the text area**
- indicate whether the input field is **optional**
- **make use of helper text** if there are further directions or hints the users may need in completing their goal (**example**: _Must be at least 6 characters and contain a number and a special character_)
- **allow copy/paste** for ease of use
- if a character counter is necessary, place it below the text area
- match the text field area to the expected size of the input - make it wide enough for the user to see their entire entry
- **write specific and indicative error texts so users understand how to fix the error**

## Don'ts

- **don't use placeholder text** in the text area - this may not be read by screen reading software, leading to accessibility issues
- **don't have a mandatory minimum** input of characters
- **don't restrict** the use of uncommon or **special characters**
- **don't disable copy and paste** functions

## When to use

- use in any situation where the user needs **to input a large, or unknown**, amount of data

## When not to use

- **do not use** when expected input is **short or limited** - use a <Link to="/eu/components/forms/text-field/usage/">Text field</Link> instead
- **do not use** when the user must respond **with specific options which are known to the organisation** - use form types such as Checkboxes, <Link to="/eu/components/forms/radio/usage/">Radio Buttons</Link> or <Link to="/eu/components/forms/select/usage/">Selects</Link> instead

## Notes

### Accessibility

- placeholder text in a text field is bad for accessibility - may not be read by screen reading software, and can be problematic for users with a visual impairment; use helper text is further information needs to be conveyed

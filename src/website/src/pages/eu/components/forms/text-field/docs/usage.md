A text field is an input that can be used on a form, sign-in or any place where data is requested from the user.

## Do's

- allow copy/paste for ease of use
- match the text field to the expected size of the input - make it wide enough for the user to see their entire entry
- write specific and clear error message texts, so users understand how to address the error

## Don'ts

- don't use placeholder text in the text field - this may not be read by screen reading software, leading to accessibility issues
- don't have a mandatory minimum input of characters
- don't restrict the use of uncommon or special characters
- don't disable copy and paste functions

## When to use

- use in any situation where the user needs to input limited amount of data (name, email address, age, etc)

## When not to use

- do not use where the user needs to input a large, or unknown amount of data
- do not use when the user must respond with specific options which are known to the organisation

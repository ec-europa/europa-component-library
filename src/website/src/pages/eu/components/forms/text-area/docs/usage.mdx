### Default

| Elements       | Mandatory | Description                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Label          | Yes       | Title of the text area                                                            |
| Helper message | No        | Additional information the user might need, to help them provide the correct data |
| Text area      | Yes       | The area where the user enters their response                                     |

### Conditional (invalid or missing input)

| Elements   | Mandatory | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error text | Yes       | A message informing the user **if** there is a problem with their entry |

## Do's

- **minimise** the number of text fields - only ask for necessary information
- **arrange them vertically** to improve scannability and reduce errors
- **group** related fields together
- **order** text fields logically, matching real-world task succession and interactions
- always **label each text field** with a short, distinct and indicative title, **placed above the text field**
- indicate whether the text field is **mandatory or optional** (to be determined by the number of instances (example: If there are 10 input fields with 7 optional fields, the mandatory fields must be indicated)
- **make use of helper text** if there are further directions or hints the users may need in completing their goal (example: Must be at least 6 characters and contain a number and a special character)
- **allow copy/paste** for ease of use
- if character counter is necessary, place it below the text field
- match the text field to the expected size of the input - make it wide enough for the user to see their entire entry
- **write specific and indicative error texts so users understand how to fix the error**

## Don'ts

- **don't use placeholder text** in the text field - this may not be read by screen reading software, leading to accessibility issues
- **don't have a mandatory minimum** input of characters
- **don't restrict** the use of uncommon or special **characters**
- **don't disable copy and paste** functions

## When to use

- use in any situation where the user needs **to input a large, or unknown**, amount of data

## When not to use

- **do not use** when expected input is **short or limited** - use a <Link to="/eu/components/forms/text-field/usage/">Text field</Link> instead
- **do not use** when the user must respond **with specific options which are known to the organisation** - use form types such as Checkboxes, <Link to="/eu/components/forms/radio/usage/">Radio Buttons</Link> or <Link to="/eu/components/forms/select/usage/">Selects</Link> instead

## Notes

### Accessibility

- placeholder text in a text field is bad for accessibility - may not be read by screen reading software, and can be problematic for users with a visual impairment; use helper text is further information needs to be conveyed

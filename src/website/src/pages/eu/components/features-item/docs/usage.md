## Introduction

Featured item is a component that makes use of the [Media container](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/eu/components/media/media-container/code/) to add visual support to a piece of content.

Optionally, it can be used as an entry point for other pages (through its CTA), or to highlight and further differentiate from other articles on the page (through its highlight stylisation).

## Do's

- select an appropriate image or video thumbnail, that is suggestive, complementary and relevant for the related content
- use a CTA only if you need to link to another page

## Don'ts

- do not choose images which are too complex to be distinguished in the media thumbnail
- do not use highlighted option unless necessary to make the piece of content stand out - the media thumbnail already gives visual prominence

## When to use

- when the media file is complementary to the content in the text block
- when you want to draw attention to a specific piece of information or media
- when the content can benefit from added visual appeal

## When not to use

- do not use when you only need to display the media without the paragraph

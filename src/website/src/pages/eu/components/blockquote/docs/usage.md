The blockquotes component is used to capture users' attention of an excerpt, testimonial, or a quote cited from the article or other sources. The design style makes the quoted section more distinguishable than the rest of the content in the web page.

## Do's

- always name the source of the quoted content
- limit the quote to no longer than 80 characters
- use the image variant to add a portrait of the quoted person

## Don'ts

- do not apply more than 2 blockquotes components in the webpage
- for the image variant, do not use a photoshopped composition of images

## When to use

- quoting something important

## When not to use

- for the purpose of emphasising text style

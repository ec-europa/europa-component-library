Messages component contains important information to alert users to take a certain actions.

## Do's

- keep the message brief and clear
- use consistent messages for the same information/success/warning/error throughout your site

## Don'ts

- overuse messages - users may ignore them and they can get in the way of a user completing their task
- write messages that are neutral. For example, instead of *The postal code you entered is invalid,* the message should say *Please enter a valid postal code*

## When to use

- when the information is essential to convey to the users in order to go to the next step
- success message: the user has performed an action which was successfully completed
- warning message: the user needs to know about the potential dangers of completing their task (for example: "you are about replace/erase your data")
- error message: the user tried to perform an action that failed because of a problem (for example: a file could not be uploaded because it wasn't the correct type of file)

## When not to use

- don't use to show non critical information

The Content item component provides a quick overview of the content it links to. The displayed elements are organised in an easily recognisable structure, intended to support scannability and decision-making through consistent interactions (e.g. linking to related pages). This is one of the most flexible components that can optionally include labels, primary metadata, image thumbnails, paragraphs, secondary metadata accompanied by icons and lastly, the horizontal description list. It can be used in lists, either vertically or part of a grid.

## Do's

- if using images, opt for assets that are related to the content and intelligible of the object depicted
- if using icons, opt for assets that are representative of the associated content

## Don'ts

- do no align images inconsistently
- do not combine multiple aspect ratios for images

## When to use

- use when you need a teaser that links to page of interest
- use as part of a list

## When not to use

- do not use for site-wide navigation - use [Navigation list composition](http://citnet.tech.ec.europa.eu/) instead

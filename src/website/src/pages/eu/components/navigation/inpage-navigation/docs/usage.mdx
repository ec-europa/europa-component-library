<Paragraph size="lead">
  The <strong>in-page navigation</strong> is a vertical menu containing
  (anchored) links to H2-headings on long content pages. It{' '}
  <strong>gives the user an overview of the page contents</strong> and has a
  fixed position (does not move while scrolling) at the{' '}
  <strong>left side of a page</strong>. This component helps users scan of the
  page quickly contents and may potentially reduce vertical scrolling, allowing
  users to easily jump straight to the segment of the page.

| Section heading   | Yes **(only on desktop)** | The **heading** of the in-page navigation - **Default: PAGE CONTENTS** (capitalised)                                                 |
| Current selection | Yes                       | Indicator of the current segment of content                                                                                          |
| Anchor link       | Yes                       | **Actionable element corresponding to the heading (H2)** of segment of content - **clicking it will scroll to the H2**               |
| Action indicator  | Yes **(only on mobile)**  | Varies depending on the state (collapsed/expanded). **Indicates what the next action will do - displays content container on click** |
| Content container | Yes **(only on mobile)**  | This element displays relevant content in a **container that's initially hidden**                                                    |

## Do's

- aim for **short, distinct headings (H2)** in order to improve scannability & reduce possible confusion
- make sure to **order content logically so there is a natural progression when looking at the headings (H2) alone**

## Don'ts

- **don't use long labels that break on the 2nd line** (30 characters) **unless necessary**

## When to use

- when you have **more than one H2** on a page

## When not to use

- don't use on a page without much content or a single H2
- don't use it to navigate beyond the page in question

## Notes

### Design

- **current selection** is indicated by a gray background color and a blue line on the left (border-left)

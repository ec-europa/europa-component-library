The category filter is a component that allows users to recognise the hierarchy of a set of items that can be filtered, and narrow down results as they select categories up to 4 levels.

## Do's

- make sure to display the number of items available in each category

## Don'ts

- do not use more than one Category filter per filter section

## When to use

- use on pool pages when you want to expose a set of categories users can filter by
- when you want to inform users on the hierarchy of items available

## When not to use

- do no use if you have one category, expose the child nodes instead
- do not use if you need to display categories further than 4 levels
- do not use when categories do not have any sub-items - use the [Default select list](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/eu/components/forms/select/code/) instead
- do not use if you want users to be able to select child nodes from different categories - use [Multiple select list](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/eu/components/forms/select/code/) instead

Cards component is used as an entry point to more detailed information. The component can include various sets of elements to serve users' specific needs.

## Do's

- only display the most relevant information on each card illustration: card with a thumbnail, title, description
- keep the amount of links on the cards as low as possible

## Don'ts

- overuse cards
- limit the amount of cards to small groups of items
- limit to 3-4 cards within a row
- display too many links on a cards, the main and ideally only action on card should remain to navigate to the content it represent.

## When to use

- browsing for information (as opposed to searching)
- grouping heterogeneous types of content
- allowing users to scan through content in small portions

## When not to use

- searching for information (as opposed to browsing).
- on small screen display avoid using too many cards as they force users to scroll down and rely on their short-term memory, creating cognitive overload, which may result in a negative user experience.

The Social Media Share component allows users to add a personalised message to a link before sharing a specific page through their preferred social media
network. It showcases the most popular ones, while the rest can be found in an overlay, by clicking the "other social networks" button.

_Tï»¿his component itself is no longer supported by ECL and the [Webtools Social bookmarking and networking](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/webtools/Social+bookmarking+and+networking) widget should be used instead._

## Do's

- maintain the same order when using native social media buttons
- follow the branding of the social media guideline
- always display the icon and the name of the social media network
- always place the component at the bottom of the page

## Don'ts

- don't display more than 4-6 social media networks, use the "_Other social networks_" link instead

## When to use

- use when you want to increase visibility of a campaign
- when you want to offer your users access to real-time, more frequently updated content that may be pushed to social media

## When not to use

- do not use if your organisation are not subscribed to the social media network

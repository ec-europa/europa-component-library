The site footer is present on every page. It provides supplementary information such as a sitemap, copyright, legal, privacy, social media and contact information as well as various links to other important sections within the Europa ecosystem, to be placed at the end of the page.

The content of the footer for the Core configuration is specific and all items mandatory.

The harmonised configuration shares the same structure and guidelines, and is organised in 2 main sections:

- The local section: with information and links related to the current site. Its content is defined by the site owner, following the guidelines of DG COMM
- The corporate part: with information applicable to the Commission as a whole. Its content is defined by DG COMM

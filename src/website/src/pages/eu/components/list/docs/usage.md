Used to present chunks of information in a concise and scannable way, lists help to organise content related to a single topic, grouping together a set of items or text options.

# Ordered lists

Ordered lists display a set of items in a sequential and logical order, indicated by a number in front of the label. Common use cases include counting, ranking or sequencing, but can be used in everything that has a hierarchy. Different list styles can be applied to list items, like numbers, roman numerals or letters, which can be used interchangeably when nesting (e.g. nested item 1 & 2 under item 3).

## Do's

- make sure the items are placed in hierarchical order so that the relation, rank or order is obvious to the user
- indicate the external links, if linking to any pages external to the European Commission
- for easy to read purpose, try to use labels that are relatively consistent in characters & width

## Don'ts

- **do not nest lists deeper than 3 levels**

## When to use

- use ordered lists when you need to display items in a specific order or to indicate hierarchy

## When not to use

- do not use it for navigation purpose
- do not use it when all items have equal value or importance
- do not use when you have one or more overarching categories that require descriptions

# Unordered list

Unordered lists are used to group related content without any particular order, with bullet points placed in front of the labels. Common use cases are much broader than ordered lists. They are used for a set of items that can be arranged in any specific order. Different bullet list styles are available to unordered list items, such as disc, circle, square or hyphen when nesting (eg. 2 sub-points under point 2).

## Do's

- indicate the external links, if linking to any pages external to the European Commission
- for easy to read purpose, try to use labels that are relatively consistent in characters & width

## Don'ts

- do not nest lists deeper than 3 levels in order to avoid clutters

## When to use

- use it when you need to display items that do not have a specific order or hierarchy

## When not to use

- do not use it for navigation purpose
- do not use it when items can be ranked, counted or sequenced
- do not use when you have one or more overarching categories or terms require descriptions

# Description lists

## Do's

- keep label short and meaningful
- order logically according to their hierarchy, significance and degree of relatedness
- avoid using long sentences
- try to use labels that are relatively consistent in characters & width
- add a meaningful description or explanation of each term

## Don'ts

- do not use an active voice
- do not nest description lists

## When to use

- use a description list when the terms in the list require a specific description or explanation
- on content pages to add additional information(such as latest update on the content of a page) or link to pages of interest

## When not to use

- do not use it for navigation purpose
- do not use it when items can be ranked, counted or sequenced

Being the building blocks of the design system, components represent simple groupings of user interface elements (e.g. a label, an input field and a button to form a search field) through which we inform users of the expected interaction steps in order to help them achieve their goal.

Every component is coded to serve a function and designed to solve a specific user interface problem. They can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with others as parts of a greater, harmonious whole.

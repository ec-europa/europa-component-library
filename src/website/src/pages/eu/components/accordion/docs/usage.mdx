<Paragraph size="lead">
  The accordion is a <strong>progressive disclosure component</strong>. Such
  components truncate information for the general layout/design and are intended
  to{' '}
  <strong>
    deliver optional additional content depending on users' interest
  </strong>
  . They help keep the interface clean and reduce scrolling by saving vertical space.
</Paragraph>

**Accordions display relevant information (through labels) at a higher level, acting as cues users scan for, while indicating that additional content or options are available through additional interaction.** For this reason, accordion header labels (collapsed state) should be as descriptive and concise as possible, allowing users to form a mental model of the information available.

| Elements         | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Action indicator | Yes       | Varies depending on the state (collapsed/expanded). Indicates what the next action will do - displays content container on click |
| Label            | Yes       | The title must describe the content within concisely                                                                             |
| Details          | Yes       | The description displays relevant content in a container that's initially hidden                                                 |

## Do's

- **order** logically, matching real-world task succession and interactions
- use **titles that are representative** of the content behind each section - this allows users to form a mental model of the information available while scanning the page
- make sure this component is needed (reduce vertical space) and users will benefit from the added interaction cost

## Don'ts

- **don't use unless it’s necessary** to truncate information for the general layout/design
- **don't use actionable items** (i.e. forms, accordions, buttons, CTAs, etc.) **or pictures in the description container** as this decreases visibility
- **don't use when there are under 3 pieces of information**
- **don't hide important information** that should be present at all times
- **don't use long titles**, keep the title to one line (character count?)
- **don't have over 7 lines of text** in the description container

## When to use

- when you need to **present multiple sections of content in a simple way** on one page, without overwhelming the user
- when it’s not critical for every user to read every section of content, but **useful when a user wants to compare different sections**
- when you can **make complex content easier to digest through descriptive headings**

## When not to use

- don't use when pages are short (reading time: under 3 minute)
- don't use when information is better structured horizontally and does not need comparison between sections - use tabs instead

## Notes

### Accessibility

- **progressive disclosure elements** can be helpful accessibility aids as **they give users the choice of revealing content to read or bypass**, making page navigation more efficient for screen-reader users and people using the keyboard or alternative input devices

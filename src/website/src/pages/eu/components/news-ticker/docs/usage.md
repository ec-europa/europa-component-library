The News ticker component allows for the display of bite-sized pieces of information.

As the name suggests, it is used to highlight the crucial and potentially urgent news, in a cycling way.

## Dos 

- keep message consistent throughout the site (although it can be used on individual pages, users may have message blindness if content is changed from one page to another)
- only use for crucial information and make sure it is placed as the first element, on top of other the page contents
- make short and concise sentences (ideally spanning no more than 2 lines or 240 characters)
- offer links (see editorial guidelines) that prompt users to follow the crucial piece of information

## Dont's

- do not use to hide important information that should be present at all times in the page

## When to use

- consistent component throughout the site - use only when there is a need to advertise and inform on a piece of content or page that is crucial and thus requires high visibility

## When not to use

- when there is a [Carousel component](https://v3--europa-component-library.netlify.app/eu/components/carousel/code/) present, as they both contain moving elements which will compete for users' attention
- do not use it for trivial or outdated information

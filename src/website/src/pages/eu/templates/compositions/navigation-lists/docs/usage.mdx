  Navigation lists support the information architecture providing users with a
  quick way to access the information they are looking for.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

The navigation list concept relies on an understanding that all "page" content type examples have the possibility of being both a parent and a child page.

The navigation list defines the children that will be shown on the parent page (current page).

[ANATOMY IMAGE]

| Name                | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title               | Yes       | This section defines the children that will be shown.                                                                                                                               |
| Summary<sup>1</sup> | No        | This section allows for a short description. It can be used when the child page has another page as its main parent or the links on the title section (grandchildren) are too long. |
| Links               | No        | Use this section to show the content inside of the child page and allow a direct link to the subpages (grandchildren).                                                              |

Notes:

- <sup>1</sup> When a child has no children (primary links) the description from that child page will be shown underneath the title of the block. A summary should always be used in the absence of links

## Do and don'ts

Do

Even if there are different types of lists on the same page it’s important to maintain a visual balance between.

Caution

Carefully consider how the lists are arranged on the page and how they behave responsively. Their positioning should support the scannability of the content.

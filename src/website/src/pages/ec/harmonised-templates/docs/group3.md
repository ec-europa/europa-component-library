### Notice

From release 3.3 onwards, the individual templates (Core, Standardised & Harmonised) can be found on the ECL **as configurations of the structurally merged components** (Site header, Page header & Footer), which now have a single, dedicated page. Concurrently, the EWG (Europa Web Guide) has also been updated to better accommodate information regarding the optionality of components & elements per site type. Please follow the corresponding links found in the table below for more information.

EC branded Harmonised group 3 websites that host specific content that answers a particular communication purpose, in particular partnership websites.

A Partnership website is where the European Commission is a co-operating
partner in its creation but is not the sole owner of the information contained
therein. It is a joint effort between the EC and non-EC partners in terms of
concept, budget, management and maintenance and requires its own individual
form of governance and custom style guides to accommodate possible
co-branding.

**NOTE**: ECL components are not mandatory in the Page body

## Do's

- make sure the pages contain all the elements in the anatomy table above

## Don'ts

- do not replace pages only on existing websites as this will create visual inconsistencies, this must be done at a site level

## When to use

- the Harmonised template must be used for all new development and can also be introduced on existing pages to replace a previous template, but this should be done on a site basis, not page by page

## When not to use

- do not follow these guidelines when you are updating sites that fall under the Core or Standardised category
- do not follow these guidelines when you are updating sites that fall under web information systems, network or internal policy websites - use Harmonised Group 1 instead
- do not follow these guidelines when you are updating sites that fall under events, campaigns or blogs - use Harmonised Group 2 instead

<Paragraph size="lead">
  <strong>
    The ECL uses an abridged version of the Bootstrap 12 column grid
  </strong>{' '}
  as the basic underlying structure for all web pages. The grid is composed of a
  set of columns, rows and containers used for aligning the content as well as
  the general layout.
</Paragraph>

## The grid:

- containers are required when using our default grid system as they are the most basic layout elements, representing a means to horizontally align components or content elements - this is done by invoking `.ecl-container`
- the column classes **express the number of columns to be engaged out of the maximum**, which is 12 per row (such as an element invoking `.ecl-col-2` occupies two columns)
- **container widths and breakpoints are expressed in pixels**
- each column has **horizontal padding (gutter) for regulating the space between** them
- **the gutters are expressed in rems**
- **the width of the columns is always proportional to the container width**, which is fixed (except for viewports <480px), and they are expressed in percentages
- the rows wrap around the columns, allowing you to specify the amount of columns content wraps around

## ECL Grid Options

The grid's breakpoints are established on the minimum width media queries, therefore the are applied on the targeted breakpoint and all those above it.

| viewport        | Extra small (≥ 0px) | Small (≥ 480px) | Medium (≥ 768px) | Large (≥ 996px) | Extra large (≥ 1140px) |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| container width | 100%                | 480px           | 768px            | 996px           | 1140px                 |
| class prefix    |  `.ecl-col-`        | `.ecl-col-sm-`  | `.ecl-col-md-`   | `.ecl-col-lg-`  | `.ecl-col-xl-`         |

## Grid offset

When using the ECL grid, there is the ability to offset columns. You can offset columns from left to right by invoking the `.ecl-offset-*` classes (where \* = the number of columns). These classes simply increase the left margin by \* number of columns.

<Playground
  system="ec"
  selectedKind="layout-grid"
  selectedStory="offset"
  showFrame
>
  <Offset />
</Playground>

## Do's

- always place content within columns
- specify the exact amount of columns content must occupy
- use **`.ecl-offset-*` grid classes** for **offsetting content**

## Don'ts

- don't use margin to offset content

<Paragraph size="lead">
  Background utilities let you edit background colours of elements.
</Paragraph>

## Accessibility warning

When changing text or background colour, make sure to always keep a high enough contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).

There are several online tools to check the contrast, for instance [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

## Background colour

By using classes `ecl-u-bg-*` you can set the background colour of an element.
Available colours are:

- `default` (white)
- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `shade`
- The <Link to="/ec/guidelines/colours/">grey palette</Link>

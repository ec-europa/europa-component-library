# Europa Component Library (EC)

The Europa Component Library (ECL) is a library of components applicable to all European Commission websites (hosted under ec.europa.eu.domain). The library contains all available components which you can use to build your website.

The Digital Transformation team (DTT) - a cross European Commission team led by DGs COMM, DIGIT, and DTT - is the owner of this library. Please contact COMM Europa Management for support on using this resource for a European Commission website.

All library elements are accompanied with

- documentation: what the component is intended for and recommendations regarding its usage
- demo: visual representation of the component
- code: technologically agnostic HTML/CSS code for implementation

Websites hosted on the corporate European Commission Next Europa CMS (based on Drupal) can also benefit from a Drupal theme implementation that is based on this same library of components.

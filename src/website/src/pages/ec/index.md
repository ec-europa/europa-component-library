# Europa Component Library

## commission.europa.eu

This library contains all available components that you can use to build your own website.

All library elements are accompanied by

- documentation explaining what a component is and how it should be used
- a visual demonstration
- HTML/CSS code for implementation

For support in building a European Commission website using the ECL, please contact [COMM Europa Management](https://digit.service-now.com/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=e2bcc0f38721fd50dd76873e8bbb35da) (CEM).

**Y﻿ou are now visiting ECL v4.** This new version mainly focuses on visual improvements of the existing components, i.e., colour palette, corners, shadows...

To ensure a coherent visual identity for the Commission’s web presence, owners of non-EWPP websites are invited to adopt the updated visual library as quickly as practically possible.

**Were you looking for ECL version 3? Follow this [link](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/v3.13.0/ec) to reach its latest version.**

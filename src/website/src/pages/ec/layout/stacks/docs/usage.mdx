## Anatomy

A stack is made of a container and of children, also called "items" here.

## Nesting

A stack can be nested inside another stack, making it possible to create a wide range of layouts.

## When to use

- Use the stack utilities when you need to arrange components horizontally or vertically.

## When not to use

- Don't use stacks when the layout you're aiming for depends on the grid.

The ECL Grid is a simplified version of the [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/).

The classes are prefixed with `.ecl-`, e.g. `.ecl-col-md-4`.

There's no `container-fluid`.

Moreover, `.ecl-col, .ecl-col-sm, ...` without the number of columns is not allowed. You have to **explicitly specify** the number of columns (out of 12).

## Breakpoints

There are four breakpoints in our responsive grid

<DisplayTokens tokens={tokens} category="breakpoints" />

## Grid

The ECL grid uses a 12 column as the basic underlying structure for all web pages. The width of the columns is adaptable to the width of the screen size.

Gutters are the gaps between the columns. Our grid contains 11 gutters of 2rems (between each column) and 1 more gutter divided in half between the first and the last column.

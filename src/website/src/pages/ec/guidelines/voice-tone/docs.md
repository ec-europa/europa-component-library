## Help the reader to scan your content

People read differently on a screen than they do on paper. They scan for clues to see what the page is about, to know if the information they want is there. Help them out by using headings, bullet points, hyperlinks and keywords.

## Put the most important information first

Give prominence to what your users want most. That's your most valuable content. The remaining information should follow in descending order of importance.

## Outcome, not process

No need for welcome messages, scene-setting or historical background. Don’t explain the process, just give readers the outcome.

## Be informal, be direct

Writing on the web is more conversational than the administrative style used in typical European Commission writing. You can write 'you' if it helps the reader understand what action to take.

## Think like a user

Write from the user’s perspective, not the institution’s, with the typical words they use when they search the internet.

## 1 paragraph, 1 idea

Each paragraph should have just 1 main idea.

## Use bullet points

They help users scan. Don't use a colon in the sentence that introduces the list

- don't use punctuation at the end of each point
- don't capitalise the first letter of each point
- each bullet should contain only 1 sentence

## Keep sentences short

Sentences should be punchy and to the point. If a sentence has 25 or more words, it should be split.

## Get good at writing titles

Keep titles short and to the point. Use plain langauge and avoid jargon or technical terms. Titles should be limited to 30 characters.

## Catchy headings

Headings help people scan the page. People often click away without reading your content if the headings aren't clear and relevant.

## Keep formatting to a minimum

Bolding is used to emphasise key ideas. But ask yourself – with your short, focused paragraphs and your clear headings, do you really need to use bold type as well? Don't use italics, and don't underline.

## Don't use jargon and keep it simple

Keep your writing simple. Don't say 'employment opportunities'. Do say 'jobs'. When using jargon, take into account that users outside of the institutions may not be familiar with certain terms.

See the [Jargon and clear writing alternatives](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=464880057) for a list of common EU jargon, complicated words and phrases and their alternatives.

## Use the active voice

Has the application process been simplified by the committee? Or did the committee simplify the application process?

## Tell the user what's behind the hyperlink

Hyperlinks catch the eye as people scan the page. Use them to let the user know where they will end up when they click. Don’t use generic labels such as 'click here', 'here', 'more' or 'read more'. Don’t use URLs. Instead, use keywords. It’s okay if your link label doesn't match the title of the page you’re linking to as long as it describes the content clearly.

## Don't capitalise (much)

Avoid overuse of capitals, especially for things like documents, laws, policy areas, programmes, events. Use only for proper nouns (people's names and place names).

## Follow the policy for dates, numbers, symbols

Dates are written like this: 29 October 2014. Do not write numbers out, use numerals instead (1, 2, 3, etc.). Decimals should appear like this: 9.7 billion people. Don't use the ampersand (&). Monetary values are presented using their monetary symbol: €150, and the percentage symbol (%) is fine, fine, fine.

## Explain abbreviations once

Write out the long form of an acronym or abbreviation the first time it appears in a text, followed by the short form in brackets. The abbreviation can be used in the text after that.

## Follow British English spelling conventions

Priorit*ise* British spelling over Americani*zation*.

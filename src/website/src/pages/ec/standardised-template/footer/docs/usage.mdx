  * <strong>Contextual</strong> – elements that may or may not feature on a
  page, depending on the communication and/or functional needs – for example,
  Login. Where the element features, use the ECL component.
</Paragraph>

## Do's

- ensure the pages contain all the elements in the anatomy table above
- group items together in the local content and place under a title (e.g. "Contact us", "Related sites") if they can be grouped, otherwise use without title

## Don'ts

- don't use more than one Footer per page

## When to use

- always use a Footer when building your page

## When not to use

- do not follow these guidelines when you are updating sites that fall under the <Link to="/ec/core-template/">Core</Link> or <Link to="/ec/harmonised-templates/group1/">Harmonised</Link> category

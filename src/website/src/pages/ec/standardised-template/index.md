As defined, the European Commission branded standardised websites host thematic content detailing, for example, policies for which the owner DG/Agency is responsible. This is the default solution to host DG-specific content (policy) and is closely aligned with the core site, providing seamless navigation and visual consistency between the first levels of the core site and the DG-managed sites.

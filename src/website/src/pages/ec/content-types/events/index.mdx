  The event content type is organised and structured throughout multiple pages (
  {<Link to="/ec/content-types/events/agenda/">agenda</Link>},{' '}
  {<Link to="/ec/content-types/events/detail/">details</Link>},{' '}
  {<Link to="/ec/content-types/events/speaker/">speaker</Link>}) in order to minimise
  the overload of information.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph size="lead">
  The content patterns for each page were created according to user research,
  which indicated how content of interest can be either arranged or progressively disclosed, by encouraging further navigation to the auxiliary pages.

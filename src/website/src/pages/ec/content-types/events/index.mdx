<Paragraph size="lead">
  The event content type is organised and structured throughout three pages
  (e.g. <Link to="/ec/content-types/events/agenda/" label="agenda" />,{' '}
  <Link to="/ec/content-types/events/detail/" label="details" />,{' '}
  <Link to="/ec/content-types/events/speaker/" label="speaker" />) so overload
  of information is minimised.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph size="lead">
  The content patterns for each page were created according to user research,
  which indicated how content of interest can be either arranged or
  progressively disclosed, by encouraging further navigation to the auxiliary
  pages.

<Paragraph size="lead">
  The research area content type is organised and structured throughout two
  pages ({<Link to="/ec/content-types/research-area/hub/" children="hub" />},{' '}
  {<Link to="/ec/content-types/research-area/spoke/" children="spokes" />}) so
  overload of information is minimised.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph size="lead">
  The content patterns for each page were created according to user research,
  which indicated how content of interest can be either arranged or
  progressively disclosed, by encouraging further navigation to the auxiliary
  pages.

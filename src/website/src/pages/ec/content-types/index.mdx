<Paragraph size="lead">
  A content type allows a pre-defined way of structuring, grouping and labeling
  related pieces of content. Based on usersâ€™ needs, content types are built to
  offer an easily identifiable pattern through which both content and components
  are used and displayed. The benefits of using a content type is a simplified
  input, design and data consistency, and easy linkage to internal other content
  of interest.

<Paragraph size="lead">
  A content type is a reusable template in a Content Management System (CMS). It
  allows you to add content to their website in a structured and consistent way.
  Fields available in a given content type are defined according to what
  research and analysis have identified as commonly needed.
</Paragraph>

By defining these fields, and inputting the information accordingly, content types help users find information more easily by ensuring content is relevant and consistently organised. Content types help content producers as they provide structures to facilitate drafting content and make information easier to manage, re-use and distribute. Content types help webmasters by providing a common template available in the Europa Components Library (ECL) for specific needs, such as policy.

Content types help the Commissionâ€™s reputation by ensuring content is easily found by search engines. Additional guidance for webmasters, particularly for sites not on Drupal, is available in the <Link to="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/EWCMS/Content+types+purpose+and+guidelines" external>Europa Web CMS Wiki</Link>.

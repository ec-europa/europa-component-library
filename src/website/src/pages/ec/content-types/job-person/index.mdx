<Paragraph size="lead">
  The job/person content type is organised and structured throughout two pages
  (e.g. <Link to="/ec/content-types/job-person/biography/" label="biography" />,{' '}
  <Link to="/ec/content-types/job-person/person-list/" label="person list" />)
  so overload of information is minimised.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph size="lead">
  The content patterns for each page were created according to user research,
  which indicated how content of interest can be either arranged or
  progressively disclosed, by encouraging further navigation to the auxiliary
  pages.

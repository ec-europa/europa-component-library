For the time being, ECL 2.0 components are composed of vanilla (simple) HTML; adaptable to any technologies while the Twig versions (to be implemented with Drupal 8) will be built within the next 3 months in preparation for the Drupal 8 upgrade.

Users can still go to ECL 1.0 to create or upgrade their websites. In 2019, we will be able to offer users a full set of components from ECL 2.0 when Drupal 8 is ready.

We will also add new components to the ECL 2.0 as we continue improving the look and feel of the existing components. New releases under 2.0 should be published periodically under Github.

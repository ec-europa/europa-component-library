  Navigation lists support the information architecture providing users with a
  quick way to access the information they are looking for.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

The navigation list concept relies on an understanding that all "page" content type examples have the possibility of being both a parent and a child page.

The navigation list defines the children that will be shown on the parent page (current page).

Notes:

- <sup>1</sup> When a child has no children (primary links) the description from that child page will be shown underneath the title of the block. A summary should always be used in the absence of links

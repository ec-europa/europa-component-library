<Paragraph size="lead">
  Lists group together related pieces of information so they are clearly
  associated with each other and easy to read. Lists are good from a structural
  point of view as they help create a well-structured and more accessible
  content. Semantically correct lists help visitors read your web site.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

Lists or "typography lists" are optimized for reading comprehension.

A list is a series of related items displayed in a single column.

Content of each item may be plain text, or other elements (links, paragraphs, ...)

A list should have a contextual coherence and allow the user to understand the message instantly.

### Nesting lists

It is perfectly ok to nest one list (of any type) inside another one.
You might want to have some sub-bullets sitting below a top level bullet.
Just make sure that nested items are all related to their parent.

Keep nested lists under control; having 4 or 5 nested level may create confusion and is generally a sign that the content has to be structured differently (break down into several lists for instance).

### Three different types of lists

- unordered list - used to group a set of related items in no particular order
- ordered list - used to group a set of related items in a specific order
- description list - used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions; Each list type has a specific purpose and meaning in a web page.

#### Unordered (bulleted) Lists

To present content when a set of items of equal status or value that can be placed in any order.

##### Example

- List of departments
- Local offices of the EU
- Local offices outside the EU
- Find a staff member
- Press contacts and accreditation

Although the items are all part of one list, you could put the items in any order and the list would still make sense:

- Press contacts and accreditation
- Local offices of the EU
- List of departments
- Local offices outside the EU
- Find a staff member

#### Ordered (numbered) Lists

Imply sequence and order, and are commonly used when giving a set of instructions or to display a list of items that should be in a specific order.

##### Example

1. Eligibility criteria
2. Registration
3. Find partners
4. Prepare your proposal
5. Submission

If the list items were moved around into a different order, the information would no longer make sense:

1. Submission
2. Find partners
3. Eligibility criteria
4. Registration
5. Prepare your proposal

Ordered lists can be displayed with several sequencing options. The default in most browsers is decimal numbers, but there are others available:

- Letters
  - Lowercase ascii letters (a, b, c…)
  - Uppercase ascii letters (A, B, C…)
  - Lowercase classical Greek: (έ, ή, ί…)
- Numbers
  - Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3…)
  - Decimal numbers with leading zeros (01, 02, 03…)
  - Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii…)
  - Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III…)
  - Traditional Georgian numbering (an, ban, gan…)
  - Traditional Armenian numbering (mek, yerku, yerek…)

#### Description lists

Description lists are flexible; you can associate more than one value with a single name, or vice versa.

For example, the term “coffee” can have several meanings, and you could show them one after the other:

coffee

- a beverage made from roasted, ground coffee beans
- a cup of coffee
- a social gathering at which coffee is consumed
- a medium to dark brown color

Or, you can associate more than one name with the same value. This is useful to show variations of a term, all of which have the same meaning:

soda,
pop,
fizzy drink,
cola

- a sweet, carbonated beverage

Note that description lists are not ordered.

## When to use

When trying to decide what type of list to use, ask yourself two simple questions:

1. Am I defining terms or associating other name/value pairs?

   - If yes, use a description list.
   - If no, don’t use a description list.

2. Is the order of the list items important?

   - If yes, use an ordered list.
   - If no, use an unordered list.

## When not to used

- To define a list of link - use navigation lists
- To display search results - use stacked items components

## DO's

- Use nesting to group items contextually into categories/sub categories
- Ensure grammatical coherence and don't mix passive with active voice or declarative sentences
- Whatever the option remain consistent

## DON’Ts

- Use lists to display search results. Instead use stacked items components
- Use lists to create navigation. Instead use navigation lists
- Use lists to display tabular data. Instead, use a Data Table

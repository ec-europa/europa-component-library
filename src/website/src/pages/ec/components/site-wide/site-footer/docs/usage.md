The site footer component is present on every page. Its content provides supplementary information such as a sitemap, copyright and legal notices, privacy and accessibility statements, social media and contact information as well as various links to other important sections within the EC ecosystem.

The content of the footer for the Core configuration is specific and all items mandatory.

The standardised and harmonised configurations share the same structure and guidelines, and are organised in 2 main sections:

- The local section: with information and links related to the current site. Its content is defined by the site owner, following the guidelines of DG COMM
- The corporate part: with information applicable to the Commission as a whole. Its content is defined by DG COMM

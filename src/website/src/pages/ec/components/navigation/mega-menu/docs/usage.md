The Mega Menu is to be used as primary navigation and can display up to 3 levels. It directs users to the pages where they need to visit and allows the following options:

- automatic: opting for this will allow to automatically populate a side navigation with parent pages & children, reflective of the site’s Information Architecture
- manual: displaying a container where users can add navigation components for a custom set-up

Disclaimer: This is currently a lab feature and changes are envisioned for the upcoming releases

## Do's

- make sure the site’s Information Architecture is well optimised - this will allow the easy display and access to the 1st and 2nd level pages, otherwise useful information will only be visible through scrolling
- try to keep page titles/ item labels short, as this component is designed for multi-column support with limited horizontal space (for ENG labels, keep in mind a 20% buffer for other languages)

## Don'ts

- do not use for anything else except the website's main navigation

## When to use

- use for primary navigation of very large websites (automatic option)
- use then you want to create custom access to pages (manual option)

## When not to use

- when you only have a one-page or shallow website

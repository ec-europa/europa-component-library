The Mega Menu is to be used as primary navigation and can display up to 3 levels. It directs visitors to the pages where they want to visit. Currently, it offers two display options on 2nd level items, specifically:

- automatic: opting for this will allow to automatically populate a side navigation with parent pages & children, reflective of the site’s information architecture
- manual: displaying a container where editors can add navigation components for a custom set-up

**Disclaimer**: This is currently a lab feature and changes are envisioned for the upcoming releases. Detailed information will be provided with the next updates.

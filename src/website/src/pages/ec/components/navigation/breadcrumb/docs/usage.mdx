## When to use

- if your website's navigational structure is a tree of more than 2 levels

## When not to use

- if your website's navigational structure has less than 3 levels of depth
- if your site navigational structure isn't a tree

## DO's

illustration: Digital Single Market > Policies > Shaping the digital single market

- Put your site name as first segment ex: "digital single market".

## DON'Ts

![Don't use "home"](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Breadcrumb/Breadcrumb_Default_01.svg)

- Put "home" as first segment. "home" is too ambiguous in the context of the EC web-presence, it could be EC homepage or the current "subsite" homepage.

Illustration: European Commission > Priorities > Digital Single Market

Illustration: European Commission > Strategy > Digital Single Market

- Put "European Commission" as a first segment, avoiding inconsistencies and dependencies with the breadcrumb from the main EC site.

<Paragraph size="lead">
  The <strong>in-page navigation</strong> is a vertical menu containing
  (anchored) links to H2-headings on long content pages. It{' '}
  <strong>gives the user an overview of the page contents</strong> and has a
  fixed position (does not move while scrolling) at either the{' '}
  <strong>left side of a page on desktop or top-bar on mobile</strong>. This
  component helps users scan of the page quickly contents and may potentially
  reduce vertical scrolling, allowing users to easily jump straight to the
  segment of the page.

| anchor link(s)    | yes               | yes              | **actionable element corresponding to the heading (H2)** of segment of content - **clicking it will jump to the H2**                 |

| content container | no                | yes              | this element displays relevant content in a **container that's initially hidden**                                                    |

## Do's

- aim for **short, distinct headings (H2)** in order to improve scannability and reduce possible confusion
- make sure to **order content logically so there is a natural progression when looking at the headings (H2) alone**

## Don'ts

- **don't use long labels that break on the 2nd line** (30 characters) **unless necessary**

## When to use

- when you have **more than one H2** on a page

## When not to use

- don't use on a page without much content or a single H2
- don't use it to navigate beyond the page in question

## Notes

### Design

- **current selection** is indicated by a gray background color and a blue line on the left (border-left)

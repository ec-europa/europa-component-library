The horizontal menu is used as a primary navigation and it can display up to 2 levels. It directs users to the pages where they need to visit.

See "[playground](/playground/ec/?path=/story/components-navigation-menu--default)" for examples.

## Do's

- keep first level items (parent pages) labels short, distinct and use maximum 16 characters including spaces, otherwise they will be hidden under a hamburger menu (☰) (for ENG labels, keep in mind a 20% buffer for other languages)
- keep second level items (child pages) labels short, distinct and use maximum 32 characters (for ENG labels, keep in mind a 20% buffer for other languages)

## Don'ts

- do not use for anything else except the website's main navigation

## When to use

- use for primary navigation

## When not to use

- when you only have a one-page or a content shallow web site

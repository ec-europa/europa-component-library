The Horizontal menu is used as a primary navigation by Standardised and Harmonised sites and it can display up to 2 levels. Further navigation (if needed) is to be carried out via navigation lists, as on the European Commission site.

## Do's

- keep first level items (parent pages) labels short, distinct and indicative consisting of maximum 16 characters including spaces, otherwise they will be hidden under a hamburger menu (☰) (for ENG labels, keep in mind a 20% buffer for other languages)
- keep second level items (child pages) labels short, distinct and indicative consisting of maximum 32 characters (ENG labels, keep in mind a 20% buffer for other languages)

## Don'ts

- do not use for anything else except the website's main navigation

## When to use

- use for primary navigation

## When not to use

- when you only have a one-page site

Note: 2nd level items are optional, case in which action indicator will not be present (e.g. Item 6 & 7 anatomy image)

<Paragraph size="lead">
  When a list of items is presented on separate pages, the pagination component
  is used at the bottom of the list to indicate the number of pages, the current
  page and to allow users to navigate to the different pages.

| Elements          | Mandatory | Description                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Page numbers      | Yes       | Pages and their corresponding value                                     |
| Current selection | Yes       | Represents the current page the user is on                              |
| Next              | Yes       | Leads users to the next page; it is not displayed on the last page      |
| Previous          | Yes       | Leads users to the previous page; it is not displayed on the first page |

## Do's

- place the **pagination below** the list of items

## Don'ts

- **don't replace** this component **with an ‘Infinite Scrolling’** feature

## When to use

- **use to break long lists** that would create too much vertical scrolling in one page

## When not to use

- don't use instead of a page-to-page navigation

## Notes

### Design

- 3 dots (…) is used to indicate that there are more pages in-between
- first and last pages are always displayed

  When a list of items is presented on multiple pages, the pagination component
  is used at the bottom of the list to indicate the number of pages, the current
  page and to allow users to navigate to the different pages.

| "next" link          | yes               | yes              | Links to the next page; it is not displayed on the last page      |

## Do's

- place the **pagination below** the list of items

## Don'ts

- **don't replace** this component **with an ‘infinite scrolling’** feature

## When to use

- **use to break long lists** that would create too much vertical scrolling in one page

## When not to use

- don't use to break unrelated content on different pages

## Notes

### Design

- 3 dots (…) is used to indicate that there are more pages in-between
- first and last pages are always displayed

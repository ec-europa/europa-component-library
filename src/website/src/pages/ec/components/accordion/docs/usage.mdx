<Paragraph size="lead">
  The accordion is a <strong>progressive disclosure component</strong>. Such
  components truncate information for the general layout/design and are intended
  to{' '}
  <strong>
    deliver optional additional content depending on users' interest
  </strong>
  . They help keep the interface clean and reduce scrolling by saving vertical space.
</Paragraph>

**Accordions display easy to scan labels of the relevant information, indicative of the additional content that is available through extra interaction.** For this reason, accordion labels (collapsed state) should be as descriptive and concise as possible, helping users to form a mental model of the information available.

| Elements          | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Action indicator  | Yes       | Varies depending on the state (collapsed/expanded). **Indicates what the next action will do - expands/collapses content container on click**                                  |
| Button            | Yes       | Actionable item (expands/collapses) - The button label must be short and **descriptive of the action that follows after being clicked**.<br/>Contains Label & Action indicator |
| Content Container | Yes       | This element displays relevant content in a **container that's initially hidden**                                                                                              |

## Do's

- use **labels that are representative** of the content inside the (initially hidden) container
- **order** logically (such as 1st quarter, 2nd quarter, 3rd quarter, 4th quarter)
- make sure this component is needed (reduce vertical space) and users will benefit from the added interaction cost

## Don'ts

- **don't use unless** users will benefit from easy-to-scan, truncated, information
- **don't use actionable items** (i.e. forms, accordions, buttons, CTAs, etc.) **or pictures in the content container** as they will have decreased visibility
- **don't use when there are under 3 pieces of information**
- **don't hide important information** that should be present at all times
- **don't use long labels**, ideally keep it to one line, **maximum 2**
- **don't have over 7 lines of text** in the content container

## When to use

- when you need to **present multiple sections of content in a simple way** on one page, without overwhelming the user (especially applicable to mobile)
- when itâ€™s not critical for every user to read every section of content, adding value **when a user wants to compare different sections (multiple content containers can be opened simultaneously)**
- when you can **make extensive and complex content easier to digest through descriptive labels**

## When not to use

- don't use when pages are short (reading time: under 3 minutes)
- don't use when information would be better structured horizontally (does not need comparison between sections) - use tabs instead

## Notes

### Accessibility

- **progressive disclosure elements** can be helpful accessibility aids as **they give users the choice of revealing content to read or bypass**, making page navigation more efficient for screen-reader users and people using the keyboard or alternative input devices
- **make sure the component is printer-friendly**, thus coded to be in the expanded state when printed

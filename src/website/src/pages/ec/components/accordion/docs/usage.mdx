<Paragraph size="lead">
  The accordion is a <strong>progressive disclosure component</strong>. Such
  components truncate information for the general layout/design and are intended
  to{' '}
  <strong>
    deliver optional additional content depending on users' interest
  </strong>
  . They help keep the interface clean and reduce scrolling by saving vertical space.
</Paragraph>

**Accordions display easy to scan labels of the relevant information, indicative of the additional content that is available through extra interaction.** For this reason, accordion labels (collapsed state) should be as descriptive and concise as possible, helping users to form a mental model of the information available.

<Paragraph size="lead">
A page banner is smaller than a hero banner. It is to be used for campaigns or on a homepage where it replaces the page header component. 
  Banners are displayed on the homepage below the site header of EC sites. It
  conveys an important message to your audience. Page banners are a good way to
  channel your visitors to complete a specific task (ex: register to an event,
  apply for funding... ). The user can choose to ignore them or interact with
  them at any time.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

Banners should have a focused message and provide users with clear actions to take. They should be placed at the top of a layout or screen. When scrolling, banners typically move with content and scroll off the screen. Only one banner should be shown at a time.

Page banner images have an aspect ratio of 4:1, meaning the width will be always four times the height of the images;

A carousel displays a message in a sequential fashion, to bring attention to high-importance items. Optionally it can link to specific content pages through a [CTA (Call to action)](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/ec/components/button/code/).

## Do's

- always use a short, distinct and indicative title or description
- if using images, make sure they are related and representative of the content, and object depicted is intelligible

## Don'ts

- do not break the message on multiple slides
- do not repeat the message on multiple slides

## When to use

- when you have multiple topics which are given high importance
- use on pages that are high in the information architecture (usually parent pages) to highlight topics and link to related pages

## When not to use

- do not use on pages presenting specific content which require a permanent title, use [Page header](http://citnet.tech.ec.europa.eu) instead

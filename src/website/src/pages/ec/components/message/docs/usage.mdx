| Icon     | Yes       | The symbol to represent the type of message                                                                                    |
| Heading  | Yes       | Type of message                                                                                                                |
| Button   | Yes       | The button to exit/dismiss the message                                                                                         |
| Message  | Yes       | **A descriptive and concise message**, indicative of the **system status** and instructing users **how to proceed or recover** |

## Do's

- **keep the message succinct** and include only valuable and relevant information
- provide **informative messages** (polite & non-technical) that convey **purpose** and what **actions users need to take** next
- **use consistent messages** for the same information/success/warning/error throughout your site

## Don'ts

- **don't over use messages** - users may ignore them and they can get in the way of a user completing their task
- **don't write messages in a way that can appear to blame the user**. For example, instead of _The postal code you entered is invalid_, the message **should say** _Please enter a valid postal code_
- **don't use all uppercase text**

## When to use

- when there is an **essential piece of information** that needs to be conveyed
- **information** message: the user needs to know **critical information before continuing** with their task
- **success** message: the user has performed an **action which was successfully completed**
- **warning** message: the user needs to know about the **potential dangers of completing their task** (for example: "you are about replace/erase your data")
- **error** message: the user tried to perform an **action that failed because of a problem** (for example: a file could not be uploaded because it wasn't the correct type of file)

## When not to use

- don't use for basic information which is not critical to the user's task. Include that on the page, not in a message

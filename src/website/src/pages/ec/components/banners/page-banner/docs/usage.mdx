<Paragraph size="lead">
  A page banner is smaller than a hero banner. Banners are displayed below the
  site header of EC sites or above the site footer. It conveys an important
  message to your audience. Page banners are a good way to channel your visitors
  to complete a specific task, for example register to an event or apply for
  funding. The user can choose to ignore them or interact with them at any time.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

Banners display a focused message and provide users with clear action to take. They are placed at the top of the page below the site header.

Page banner images have an aspect ratio of 4:1, meaning the width will be always four times the height of the images.

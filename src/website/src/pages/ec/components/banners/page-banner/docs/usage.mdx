<Paragraph size="lead">
  A page banner is smaller than a hero banner. The banner is displayed below the
  European Commission site header. It is the first image users see when they
  come to the page. It can be used to promote a specific message you have in
  mind. It is also a specific place where you can provide a call to action
  button to take your users to a detail page.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

Banners display a focused message and provide users with clear action to take. They are placed at the top of the page below the site header.

Page banner images have an aspect ratio of 4:1, meaning the width will be always four times the height of the images.

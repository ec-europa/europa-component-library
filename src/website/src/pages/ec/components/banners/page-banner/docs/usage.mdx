<Paragraph size="lead">
  A page banner is smaller than a hero banner. The banner is displayed below the
  European Commission site header. It is the first image users see when they
  come to the page. It can be used to promote a specific message you have in
  mind. It is also a specific place where you can provide a call to action
  button to take your users to a detail page.

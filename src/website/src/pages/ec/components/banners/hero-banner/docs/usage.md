The hero banner is a large, eye-catching banner stretching the full width of the page. A hero banner can have different appearances depending on the background chosen, the alignment of the text box and whether a description is used within the text box. There is always a call-to-action button to invite the user to go to a page with more info on the subject.

## When to use it

The hero banner is only to be used on campaign pages when there is a strong message to communicate to your users.

The image should be:

- relevant
- high quality
- emotionally persuasive

## When not to use it

Large images can be intrusive and overwhelming, especially if they are intended to stay for a long time. In this case, users will not be engaged by the visual element, and will most likely not visit the site anymore.

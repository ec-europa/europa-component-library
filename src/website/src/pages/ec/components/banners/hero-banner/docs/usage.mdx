<Paragraph size="lead">
  A Hero banner displays a prominent message and related action. Banners are
  displayed on the homepage below the site header of EC sites. It conveys an
  important message to your audience. Hero banners are a good way to channel
  your visitors to complete a specific task, for example register to an event or
  apply for funding. The user can choose to ignore them or interact with them at
  any time.

## Anatomy

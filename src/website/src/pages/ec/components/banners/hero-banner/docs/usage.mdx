  A Hero banner displays a prominent message and related action. Banners are
  displayed on the homepage below the site header of European Commission sites.
  It conveys an important message to your audience. Hero banners are a good way
  to channel your visitors to complete a specific task, for example register to
  an event or apply for funding. The user can choose to ignore them or interact
  with them at any time.

<Paragraph size="lead">
  A Hero banner displays a prominent message and related action. Banners are
  displayed on the homepage below the site header of European Commission sites.
  It conveys an important message to your audience. Hero banners are a good way
  to channel your visitors to complete a specific task, for example register to
  an event or apply for funding. The user can choose to ignore them or interact
  with them at any time.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

Banners display a focused message and provide users with clear action to take. They are placed at the top of the page below the site header.

Hero banner images have an aspect ratio of 3:1, meaning the width will be always three times the height of the images.

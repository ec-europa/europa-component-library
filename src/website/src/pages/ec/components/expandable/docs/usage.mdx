  components truncate information for the general layout/design and are intended
  to <strong>deliver additional content depending on users' interests</strong>.
  They help keep the interface clean and reduce scrolling by saving vertical
  space, while being{' '}

    indicative of the additional content that is available through extra

## Do's

- **use a button label for each item** with a short, distinct and indicative title of the hidden content

## Don'ts

- **don't use with large blocks of content**
- **don't hide important information** that should be present at all times

## When to use

- use when additional information is offered that will **only benefit a small group of users**
- when you can **make extensive and complex content easier to digest through descriptive labels**

## When not to use

- do not use as a button
- do not use it consecutively - use <Link to="/ec/components/accordion/usage/">accordions</Link> instead
- don't use when pages are short (reading time: under 3 minutes)

## Notes

### Accessibility

- **progressive disclosure elements** can be helpful accessibility aids as **they give users the choice of revealing content to read or bypass**, making page navigation more efficient for screen-reader users and people using the keyboard or alternative input devices

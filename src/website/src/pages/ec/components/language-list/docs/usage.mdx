<Paragraph size="lead">
  The Language List is the <strong>language selector</strong> of the European
  Commission sites. Users are presented with the language list when they first
  access the site, or through the language switcher at the top-right corner of
  any page.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

There are **2 versions** of the component. One version is shown initially when a user arrives at the site. The second version is for a user to switch their language preference.

- **desktop is a 2 column layout** which displays the available language choices
- **mobile design is a single column layout** which allows the user to scroll to select their language

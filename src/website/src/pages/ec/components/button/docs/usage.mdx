  action.

| Elements | Mandatory | Description                                                                    |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Label    | yes       | label of the button                                                            |
| Icon     | no        | affordance or action indicator that compliments the label or adds an indicator |

## Do's

- ensure the button directs to a pre-defined goal, such as 'Search by priority'

## Don'ts

- do not use more than once per page (except where the main action or user goal is repeated on the same page)

## When to use

- when you have a main goal you want to direct users to

## When not to use

- do not use for site navigation

## Notes

### Design

- links can also be styled as CTAs when the goal linked to the main action is navigation

### Positioning

- positioned on the bottom left of the container, following written content principles

# Primary Button

<Paragraph size="lead">
  Primary buttons are used for main actions. The design uses a high contrast
  compared to the background, ensuring an easily distinguishable visual
  hierarchy.

| Elements | Mandatory | Description                                                                    |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Label    | yes       | label of the button                                                            |
| Icon     | no        | affordance or action indicator that compliments the label or adds an indicator |

## Do's

- make sure the buttons' microcopy represents the action the system will run, such as 'Submit' or 'Register'

## Don'ts

- don't assign an action that should be assigned for a CTA

## When to use

- when you have one main action or user goal per section of content

## When not to use

- do not use for site navigation
- do not use for downloads
- do not use when the primary action is negative - use secondary or ghost buttons instead

## Notes

### Positioning

- position at the bottom right corner - as this is the last place users will look according to normal F-shaped reading patterns

# Secondary Button

<Paragraph size="lead">
  Ghost buttons should only be used to highlight the priority of an action that
  should be distinguishable from other buttons. They can either be used to
  indicate a negative primary action, along with a primary action, or for
  non-primary actions.

## Notes

# Genral Notes

## Accessibility

- ensure buttons are tagged with the `<button>` tag, in accordance with the WCAG2 for easy accessibility
- ensure the positive selection comes first and the negative second, such as 'Would you like to continue? Yes or No'

## Design

- **positive primary action**
  - a primary action should be distinguishable from the secondary/ghost button
    ![positive primary action](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/buttons-contrast-regular.png)

* **negative primary action**
  - a negative primary action should be less visually contrasting as it can cause negative consequences when used accidentally - use solid button for Secondary action and ghost button for Primary action

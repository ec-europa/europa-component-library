## Anatomy

| Name  | Constraint |
| ----- | :--------: |
| Label | Mandatory  |
| Icon  |  Optional  |

### Use of labels

Labels show users what will happen when they click the button.

- Should be clear and distinct.
- Use verbs that describe the action, such as Send, Add or Delete.
- Keep it short, no more than 3 words.

### Use of icons

Button with an icon indicates a specific action and it reinforces or clarifies the meaning of a label.
Icons can be on right or left of your label.

### Colour

Ensure that the button background colour or label colour in the case of the ghost button provides sufficient contrast with the context/section background.

## When to use

To trigger an action. _ Actions which affect the website's state are buttons. _
Actions include: Search, Submit... etc.

An action is performed when the user interact actively with the website, ex: the user post a comment.

There are 5 types of buttons with 5 different use cases.
The button with the strongest visual weight will attract the most attention.

| Button name                 | Visual style                                                                                            | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call-to-action (CTA) button | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_CTA_Default.png)       | funnel users into the most important action for your business ex: "Apply for funding" or "Watch live streaming". Limit to one CTA on a given page, the same CTA can be repeated within in the page. |
| Primary button              | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Primary_Default.png)   | Only 1 primary action per context/section of the page, Primary buttons can appear in a few occurence on a page. ex: "submit","register"...                                                          |
| Secondary button            | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Secondary_Default.png) | Secondary action that users can perform on the page and it can be used multiple times per context/section in the page. ex: "show more", "expand", "see details".                                    |
| Ghost button                | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Ghost_Default.png)     | When an action does not require dominance on a page. Often use next to a primary action ex: On a form context/section "Submit" as primary, "Cancel" as a ghost.                                     |
| Search button               | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Search_Default.png)    | use exclusively for the search function.                                                                                                                                                            |

## When not to use

For navigational purposes. If the action triggered sends a user to a different page, opens up a page in a new tab or jump to another section within the current page, use <Link to="/ec/components/navigation/link/usage/">links</Link> instead because these actions don’t change anything on the website’s state.
The user is passive, browsing through content (read only).

## DO's

- Avoid using icons on buttons
- When you do need icons:

  - For LTR languages, left aligned icon flows better with the text.

    illustration: Primary button, label "Approve", icon left "check"

  - Place icons to the right for buttons with multiple status ex: expand/collapse buttons

    illustration: Secondary button, label "Expand" icon right "arrow-down"

## DON'Ts

- Use button for navigation, use <Link to="/ec/components/navigation/link/usage/">links</Link> instead.

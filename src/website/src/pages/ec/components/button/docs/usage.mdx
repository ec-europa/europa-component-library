  Use a button to trigger and carry out an action on a page.
</Paragraph>

## When to use

The ECL has five buttons with different visual designs to make a distinction between the kind of action the button will carry out.

| Button name           | Visual style                                                                                            | Usage                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call-to-action button | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_CTA_Default.png)       | for the most important action on the page like "Apply for funding" or "Watch live streaming". |
| Primary button        | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Primary_Default.png)   | for primary actions in forms, to initiate a search query or to apply a filter.                |
| Secondary button      | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Secondary_Default.png) | or secondary actions.                                                                         |
| Ghost button          | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Ghost_Default.png)     | when an action does not require dominance on a page, for instance to "cancel" a form.         |
| Search button         | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Search_Default.png)    | use exclusively for the search function.                                                      |

Each page can have one to two Primary (or Call-to-action) buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as Secondary or Ghost buttons.

### Button labels

Button labels tell users what will happen when they click the button. Use verbs that describe the action, such as Send, Add or Delete. Do not use capitalization on buttons (only the first word in a phrase and proper nouns are capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels.

### Button icons

It is possible to add an icon to a button to enhance the action.

| Button name           | Visual style                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call-to-action button | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_CTA-Icon_Default.png)     |
| Primary button        | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Primary_icon_Default.png) |

## When not to use

Do not use Buttons to send the user to another page or for navigational purposes. Use links instead, as they are not associated with an action.

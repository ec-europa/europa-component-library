  Use a button to trigger and carry out an action on a page.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy 

Buttons use 3 major attributes: colour, typography (labels) and iconography.
- Labels
-- should be clear and distinct. Try using verbs to describe the action that the user will perform when interacting with the button. Keep it short, no more than 3 words and only capitalise the first word. 
- Colour 
-- choose a colour that provides sufficient contrast between the label and background. Icon ​- choose an icon that can reinforce or ​clarify​ the ​meaning of a ​label​ in that particular context.

## When to use

To trigger an action. Actions * which affect the website's state are buttons. * Actions include: Sign up, Login, Register, Search, Submit... etc 
An action is when the user interact actively with the website, ex: the user post a comment.

The ECL has five buttons with different visual designs to make a distinction between the kind of action the button will carry out.
The button with the strongest visual weight will attract the most attention.

### Button labels

Button labels tell users what will happen when they click the button. Use verbs that describe the action, such as Send, Add or Delete. Do not use capitalization on buttons (only the first word in a phrase and proper nouns are capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels.

### Button icons

It is possible to add an icon to a button to better illustrate the action.

| Button name           | Visual style                                                                                               |

| Primary button        | ![Button Image](https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/Buttons/Button_Primary_icon_Default.png) |

## When not to use Don't use buttons 

For navigational purposes. If the action triggered sends a user to a different page or opens up a page in a new tab or jump to another section within the current page, use links instead because these actions don’t change anything on the website’s state. 
The user is passive, browsing through content (read only).

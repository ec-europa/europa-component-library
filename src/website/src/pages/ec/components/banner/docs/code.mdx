## Image banner

  selectedKind="components-banner"
  selectedStory="image"
  showFrame
>
  <Html markup={bannerImage} />
</Playground>

## Video banner

<Playground
  system="ec"
  selectedKind="components-banner"
  selectedStory="video"
  showFrame

  <Html markup={bannerVideo} />
</Playground>

## Other variants

Several variants are available for all kind of banner: size, font, background and text color, horizontal and vertical alignment, ...

Check the playground for more information.

## Banner width

Banners placed inside a grid container (`.ecl-container`) will expand to this container width.

To have a full width banner, the recommanded way is to place it outside of the grid container.

However, if there is a need to have a full width banner inside the grid container, the css class `.ecl-banner--fullwidth` can be used (just put it at the same level as `.ecl-banner`).

**Caution**: if you plan to use full width banner using this fullwidth css class, we recommend to include the optional `ecl-reset.css`, as some global rules here would improve the display (`overflow-x: hidden`).

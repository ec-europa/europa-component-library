### Default

| Elements    | Mandatory | Description                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heading     | Yes       | Title of the text input field                                                     |
| Helper text | No        | Additional information the user might need, to help them provide the correct data |
| Text field  | Yes       | The area where the user enters their response                                     |

### Conditional

| Elements           | Mandatory | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Optional Indicator | Yes       | Indicator stating **if** input fields are **optional**                  |
| Error message      | Yes       | A message informing the user **if** there is a problem with their entry |

## Do's

- **allow copy/paste** for ease of use
- match the text field to the expected size of the input - make it wide enough for the user to see their entire entry
- **write specific and clear error message texts, so users understand how to address the error**

## Don'ts

- **don't use placeholder text** in the text field - this may not be read by screen reading software, leading to accessibility issues
- **don't have a mandatory minimum** input of characters
- **don't restrict** the use of uncommon or special **characters**
- **don't disable copy and paste** functions

## When to use

- use in any situation where the user needs **to input limited** amount of data (name, email address, age, etc)

## When not to use

- do not use where the user needs **to input a large, or unknown**, amount of data - if longer, use a <Link to="/ec/components/forms/text-area/usage/">Textarea</Link> instead
- do not use when the user must respond with specific options which are known to the organisation - use form types such as Checkboxes, <Link to="/ec/components/forms/radio/usage/">Radio Buttons</Link> or <Link to="/ec/components/forms/select/usage/">Select</Link> instead

## Notes

### Accessibility

- placeholder text in a text field is bad for accessibility - may not be read by screen reading software, and can be problematic for users with a visual impairment; use helper text if further information needs to be conveyed

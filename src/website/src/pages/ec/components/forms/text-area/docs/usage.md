A textarea is an input field allowing users to enter multiple lines of text.

## Do's

- minimise the number of input fields - only ask for necessary information
- arrange them vertically for better layout and readability
- group related fields together
- order input fields logically, matching real-world task succession and interactions
- always label each text area with a short, descriptive title, placed above the text area
- indicate whether the input field is optional or mandatory
- make use of helper text if there are further directions or hints the users may need in completing their goal (example: _Must be at least 6 characters and contain a number and a special character_)
- allow copy/paste for ease of use
- if a character counter is necessary, place it below the text area
- match the text field area to the expected size of the input - make it wide enough for the user to see their entire entry
- write specific and descriptive error message for easy comprehension

## Don'ts

- don't use placeholder text in the text area - this may not be read by screen reading software, leading to accessibility issues
- don't have a mandatory minimum input of characters
- don't restrict the use of uncommon or special characters
- don't disable copyand paste functions

## When to use

- use in any situation where the user needs to input a large, or unknown, amount of data

## When not to use

- do not use when expected input is short
- do not use when the user must respond with specific options which are known to the organisation

The Rating field is an interactive component through which users can submit a easily quantifiable rating or feedback from on their experience with a process (e.g. waiting time, form completion, etc.), but can also be potentially used for content (e.g. media, translation quality, etc). Multiple sizes and/or icons are being considered.

## Do's

- always make sure you use a short, distinct and indicative label
- ensure content is contextual and specific to the rating the user is expected to give (e.g. waiting time, translation quality, etc.)
- indicate whether the input group is optional or mandatory
- make use of helper text if there are further directions or hints the users may need in completing their goal
- write specific and clear error messages, so users understand how to properly address and recover from the error

## Don'ts

- although possible, usage without label or helper text is not recommended, and should be restricted to cases where the rating field is used in a pre-defined context, such as part of another component

## When to use

- when there is a need/option for users to rate something

## When not to use

- do not use in cases where inputs are better being of qualitative input, use a [Text field](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/ec/components/forms/text-field/code/) or [Text area](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/ec/components/forms/text-area/code/) instead

Tags are used to provide contextual information. When clicked they go to to content within the same category. Tags are also used as keywords in search boxes, filters and category lists. In some cases they can be added or removed by the user.

## When to use it

- showing information which helps a user make sense of the content on the page, such as filter parameters or object metadata.
- use to display information that clarifies the content on the page, such as metadata.
- use to enable the tag text to navigate to other pages or additional information.

## When not to use it

- Creating an object whose primary function is triggering an interaction. Instead, use a button
- Offering a description of an object that exceeds 3â€“5 words. Instead, consider using a tooltip
- Tags increase the visual noise on a page, particularly when multiple tags are used or when combined with other visual labeling elements. - So keep in mind to use them in moderation.

<Paragraph size="lead">
  The date block is a visual display to support an event listing. It displays
  the day, month and year of an event and has a total of 5 states: upcoming,
  ongoing, cancelled, past and rescheduled. The date blocks cannot be used as a
  stand-alone component, always being complemented by informative tags, acting
  as an extra indicator for any given state of the event. Together with the
  event listing, they form the date block composition.

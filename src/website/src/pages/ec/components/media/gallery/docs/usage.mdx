<Paragraph size="lead">
  A media gallery is a collection of images, videos or audio files that allows a
  user to quickly browse media related to the page content. The media gallery
  can include multiple types of formats and sometimes act as links to other
  pages or sites.

| Elements        | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Media thumbnail | Yes       | Thumbnail representative of the linked media                                                                                                 |
| Media icon      | Yes       | Icon indicating the type of media                                                                                                            |
| Caption         | No        | Use caption indicative of the media linked content - this allows users to form a mental model of the information available<br />\* see notes |

## Do's

- always include thumbnails
- always include ALT tag
- write captions that are short, distinct and indicative and communicate the subject of the media content that is linked
- select appropriate images for media thumbnails, they need to depict what is in the audio or video file
- select matching icon overlays to indicate the type of media, i.e. audio icon, video icon

## Don'ts

- don't automatically play audio or video files when a user arrives on a page (or scrolls to a media gallery)
- don't automatically play next items after an audio or video item finished
- don't choose images which are too complex to be distinguished in thumbnail size

## When to use

- where there are several media files - if there are under 5 items, use an <Link to="/ec/components/list/usage/">unordered list</Link> or a <Link to="/ec/components/media/media-container/usage/">media container</Link>
- where there is no need to prioritise or highlight specific media files, i.e. files are equally important in terms of content

## When not to use

- do not use the gallery when media items have a content hierarchy
- do not use the gallery when specific items should be highlighted

## Notes

### Accessibility

- Ensure the ALT tag for each media file accurately describes the subject (such as for an image: "Undergraduate student looking into microscope to examine specimen in biology laboratory" instead of something generic like "Science image 1")

### Design

- Captions
  - Desktop: display on hover
  - Mobile: display under the thumbnail

| Name       | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Media      | Yes       | Title must describe the downloadable file                                                                                                                        |
| Media icon | Yes       | Icon indicating the type of media                                                                                                                                |
| Caption    | No        | Use caption <strong>representative</strong> of the media content - this allows users to form a mental model of the information available while scanning the page |

## Do's

- **be descriptive and concise in the caption** to communicate the subject of the media file
- **write captions that are short, distinct and indicative** and communicate the subject of the media content
- **include ALT tag**
- **select appropriate images** for video thumbnails, they need to depict what is in the audio or video file
- place icon overlays to indicate the type of media, i.e. audio icon, video icon.

## Don'ts

- **don't automatically play audio or video files** when a user arrives on a page (or scrolls to a media gallery)
- **don't automatically play next items** after an audio or video item finished
- don't choose images which are too complex to be distinguished in thumbnail size

## When to use

- where there are several media files - if there are under 5 items, use use an <Link to="/ec/components/list/usage/">unordered list</Link> or a <Link to="/ec/components/media/media-container/usage/">media container</Link>
- where there is no need to prioritise or highlight specific media files, i.e. files are equally important in terms of content

## When not to use

- do not use the gallery when media items have a content hierarchy
- do not use the gallery when specific items should be highlighted

## Notes

### Accessibility

- Ensure the **ALT tag for each media file accurately describes the subject** (e.g. for an image: "Undergraduate student looking into microscope to examine specimen in biology laboratory" instead of something generic like "Science image 1")

### Design

- Captions
  - Desktop: display on hover
  - Mobile: display under the thumbnail

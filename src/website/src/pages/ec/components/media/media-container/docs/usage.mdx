| Elements        | Mandatory desktop | Mandatory mobile | Description.                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| media thumbnail | yes               | yes              | thumbnail representative of the linked media                                                                                                    |
| caption         | no                | no               | use caption representative of the media content - this allows users to form a mental model of the information available while scanning the page |

## Do's

- always include thumbnails
- be descriptive and concise in the caption to communicate the subject of the media file
- write captions that are short, distinct and indicative and communicate the subject of the media content
- include ALT tag
- select appropriate images for video thumbnails, they need to depict what is in the audio or video file

## Don'ts

- don't choose images which are too complex to be distinguished in thumbnail size
- don't automatically play audio or video files when a user arrives on a page (or scrolls to a media container)
- don't automatically play next items after an audio or video item finished

## When to use

- whenever there is a need to display a media file
- when you want to display content that's found on external sources (A-V Portal, Youtube, Vimeo, etc., done through iFrame)

## When not to use

- do not use the media container if there are above 5 consecutive items (this would make navigation more difficult) - use an <Link to="/ec/components/list/usage/">unordered list</Link> or a <Link to="/ec/components/media/gallery/usage/">media gallery</Link>

## Notes

### Accessibility

- make sure the ALT tag for each media file accurately describes the subject (such as for an image: "Undergraduate student looking into microscope to examine specimen in biology laboratory" instead of something generic like "Science image 1").
- make a text transcript available, representative of the media content

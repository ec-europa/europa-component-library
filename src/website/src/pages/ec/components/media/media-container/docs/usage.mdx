  A media container is used to <strong>display media items</strong> (video,
  audio, image or other data) <strong>with a caption</strong>.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

The navigation list concept relies on an understanding that all "page" content type examples have the possibility of being both a parent and a child page.

The navigation list defines the children that will be shown on the parent page (current page).

| Media   | Yes       | Title must describe the downloadable file                                                                                                           |
| Caption | No        | Use caption **representative** of the media content - this allows users to form a mental model of the information available while scanning the page |

## Do's

- **be descriptive and concise in the caption** to communicate the subject of the media file
- **write captions that are short, distinct and indicative** and communicate the subject of the media content
- **include ALT tag**
- **select appropriate images** for video thumbnails, they need to depict what is in the audio or video file

## Don'ts

- don't choose images which are too complex to be distinguished in thumbnail size
- **don't automatically play audio or video files** when a user arrives on a page (or scrolls to a media container)
- **don't automatically play next items** after an audio or video item finished

## When to use

- Whenever there is a need to display a media file

## When not to use

- Do not use the media container if there are above 5 consecutive items (this would make navigation more difficult) - use an <Link to="/ec/components/list/usage/">unordered list</Link> or a <Link to="/ec/components/media/gallery/usage/">media gallery</Link>

## Notes

### Accessibility

- Ensure the **ALT tag for each media file accurately describes the subject** (e.g. for an image: "Undergraduate student looking into microscope to examine specimen in biology laboratory" instead of something generic like "Science image 1").
- **Make a text transcript available**, representative of the media content

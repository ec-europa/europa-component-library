A media container is used to display media items (video, audio, image or other data) with a caption.

## Do's

- always include thumbnails
- be descriptive and concise in the caption to communicate the subject of the media file
- write captions that are short, distinct and indicative and communicate the subject of the media content
- include ALT tag
- select appropriate images for video thumbnails, they need to depict what is in the audio or video file

## Don'ts

- don't choose images which are too complex to be distinguished in thumbnail size
- don't automatically play audio or video files when a user arrives on a page (or scrolls to a media container)
- don't automatically play next items after an audio or video item finished

## When to use

- whenever there is a need to display a media file
- when you want to display content that's found on external sources (A-V Portal, Youtube, Vimeo, etc., done through iFrame)

## When not to use

- do not use the media container if there are above 5 consecutive items (this would make navigation more difficult)

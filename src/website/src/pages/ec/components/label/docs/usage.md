Labels are used to indicate the different states for items in a list. They bring supplementary meaning by adding an indicative state (label) that is visually distinct (background colour) from other elements.

## Do's

- keep the message consistent on a single list of items and express meaning based on the content in which it is being used (e.g. "canceled" for events)
- keep the label succinct (1-2 words)

## Don'ts

- don't use 2 labels at the same time (in one list)

## When to use

- when you have items in a list with multiple states (e.g. featured item & generic list item; canceled, rescheduled & upcoming event)

## When not to use

- when all items in a list have the same state (e.g. search list items)

<Paragraph size="lead">
  A Hero banner displays a prominent message and related optional actions.
  Banners are displayed on the homepage below the site header of EC sites. It
  conveys an important message to your audience. Hero banners are a good way to
  channel your visitors to complete a specific task (ex: register to an event,
  apply for funding... ). The user can choose to ignore them or interact with
  them at any time.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

Banners should have a focused message and provide users with clear actions to take. They should be placed at the top of a layout or screen. When scrolling, banners typically move with content and scroll off the screen. Only one banner should be shown at a time.

Hero banner images have an aspect ratio of 3:1, meaning the width will be always three times the height of the images;

<Paragraph size="lead">
  A Hero banner displays a prominent message and related action.
  Banners are displayed on the homepage below the site header of EC sites. It
  conveys an important message to your audience. Hero banners are a good way to
  channel your visitors to complete a specific task (ex: register to an event,
  apply for funding... ). The user can choose to ignore them or interact with
  them at any time.

## Anatomy

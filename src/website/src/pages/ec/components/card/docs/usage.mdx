<Paragraph size="lead">
  Cards act as an entry point to more detailed information. A card is container
  for a few short, related pieces of information. It roughly resembles a playing
  card in size and shape, and is intended as a linked, short representation of a
  conceptual unit.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

Card layouts can vary to support the types of content they contain.

| Elements    | Mandatory |
| ----------- | --------- |
| thumbnail   | no        |
| title       | yes       |
| description | no        |
| meta        | no        |
| tags        | no        |
| infos       | no        |

## When to use

- browsing for information (as opposed to searching)
- grouping heterogeneous types of content
- allowing users to scan through content in small portions
  - to display structured content
  - to make information discoverable
- the user goals that the card-based web design best responds to:
  - scrolling through
  - scanning through
  - browsing through

## When not to use

- searching for information (as opposed to browsing).
- on small screen display avoid using too many cards as they force users to scroll down and rely on their short-term memory. This creates a cognitive overload, a negative user experience.

## Do's

- use cards to emphasize on contents
- only display the most relevant information on each card
  illustration: card with a thumbnail, title, description
- keep the amount of links on the cards as low as possible

## Don'ts

- overuse cards
- limit the amount of cards to small groups of items
- limit to 3-4 cards within a row
- use cards as an image gallery, use <Link to="/ec/components/media/gallery/usage">gallery</Link> instead.
- use cards to display images or video, use <Link to="/ec/components/media/media-container/usage">media container</Link> instead.
- display too many links on a cards, the main and ideally only action on card should remain to navigate to the content it represent.

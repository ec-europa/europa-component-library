  legend={{
    items: [
      {
        color: '#404040',
        label: 'mandatory',
      },
      {
        color: '#004494',
        label: 'optional',
      },
    ],
  }}

| Elements | Mandatory | Description              |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| Headings | yes       | Columns headlines        |
| Cells    | yes       | Actual data in the cells |

## Do's

- reduce the table width to fit the content
- align content left to right within a cell
- use a dash ( - ) in null data cells
- adjusts the styling to render a small/large table

## Don'ts

- don't spell out numbers
- don't use colour alone to convey information

## When to use

- use when you want to store and show large/small amounts of info, static data
- use when you want to make comparisons

## When not to use

- when you don't have any relationship among content you want to present

## Notes

### Design

When including text links, use a different color to highlight this - just bolding or underlining the text doesn’t provide enough of a visual cue

| <Link to="/ec/components/navigation/link/usage/">link / CTA link</Link>       | no        | link to either internal or external source (default label: "Read more", can be overwritten to indicate what CTA or the following system actions) |

## Do's

- always place at the top of the page
- always include thumbnails
- select an appropriate image or video thumbnail, that is suggestive, complementary and relevant for the related content
- make sure that the height of the text does not exceed the height of the media container

## Don'ts

- don't use a CTA link if the page already contains one
- don't use more than one composition on a single page
- don't choose images which are too complex to be distinguished in thumbnail size

## When to use

- whenever there is a need to display a media file with a paragraph 
- when a page can benefit from added visual appeal 
- when the media file is complementary to the content available on that page

## When not to use

- do not use when you only need to display the media without the paragraph, use <Link to="/ec/components/media/media-container/usage/">Media container</Link> instead

## Exceptions

- <Link to="/ec/harmonised-templates/group2/">harmonised group 2</Link>

  - placement at the top of the page is optional
  - you can use more than one composition per page
  - if using links in multiple compositions, keep only the most important link as <Link to="/ec/components/navigation/link/usage/">Call-to-action link</Link> (while leaving the rest as regular links)

## Anatomy

The navigation list concept relies on an understanding that all "page" content type examples have the possibility of being both a parent and a child page.

The navigation list defines the children that will be shown on the parent page (current page).

| Title               | yes       | this section defines the children that will be shown.                                                                                                                               |
| Summary<sup>1</sup> | no        | this section allows for a short description. It can be used when the child page has another page as its main parent or the links on the title section (grandchildren) are too long. |
| Links               | no        | use this section to show the content inside of the child page and allow a direct link to the subpages (grandchildren).                                                              |

Notes:

- <sup>1</sup> When a child has no children (primary links) the description from that child page will be shown underneath the title of the block. A summary should always be used in the absence of links

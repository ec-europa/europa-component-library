## Getting started

The Europa Component Library is a design system for the European Commission and websites managed by the Commission.

We provide design guidelines and code to help users create consistent and accessible government web presence.

All library elements are accompanied by:

- documentation explaining what the component is intended for and how it should be used
- a visual demonstration of the component
- HTML/CSS code for implementation

New components are continuously being added to the library. The team is also constantly updating visual guidelines for designers in the Guidelines section, where we provide detailed information about design principles and resources.

The Europa Component Library is a design system defining the visual identity of the European Commission on the web.

It provides design guidelines and code to help users create consistent and accessible web presence.

All library elements are accompanied by:

- documentation explaining what the component is intended for and how it should be used
- a visual demonstration of the component
- HTML/CSS code for implementation

New components are continuously being added to the library. The team is also constantly updating visual guidelines for designers in the Guidelines section, where we provide detailed information about design principles and resources.

## How to use ECL

ECL distributes its resources in different way, depending on the implementation approach, things might change, but generally speaking, given the HTML markup defined by ECL, using the distrbuted css and javascript on top of it it would ensure the desired look and feel.

### Where to get it?

**ECL is distributed mainly as npm packages providing the needed resources, this is the recommended way of getting it**, when used in a node project it is surely the easiest and more reliable way, the new versions can be automatically detected and fetched and the ECL resources could be even rebuilt on the client side by fetching all the needed packages one by one.

In every release, starting from 3.9.1, a file containing a list of all the available packages on npm is deployed on the github release page, this list is quite long and you don't surely need, in a normal situation, to know all the available packages as you don't need to fetch them all.

#### Main package

The main ECL package that is absolutely needed is:

- preset-ec

In this package all the css, js and resources like icons and logos are present, there is no need, then, to look for other packages holding part of these resources.

### Alternative approaches:

ECL is also distributing its resources on a CDN, all the files distributed in the package mentioned before are also available in the CDN, this is the pattern to reach the ecl resources:
`https://cdn{1,2,3 or 4}.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/ecl/{tag}/{system}/{path/to/the/asset}`

Ex: https://cdn1.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/ecl/v3.9.1/ec/styles/optional/ecl-ec-default.css

These resources can be used loading them directly from the CDN, knowing that it's not possible to serve svgs from an external domain, though, for this to happen check the "additional information" section below.

For css and js files, if loaded from the CDN, it is recommended to add an integrity attribute for each of the files loaded using the sri codes you find in every release page.

Ex: `<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn1.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/ecl/v3.9.1/ec/styles/optional/ecl-ec-default.css"
  integrity="sha256-XlVWuOrSIX13Qh+TIFD6TEdWkd3Ke94QZi552iwvbUk= sha384-nHJLW2KyTiXPnjHGmc7bWbV61vKnB2q1Uz6A3xKtgz6oSV8l4Wn5kUA2qIOdJzDG sha512-E7CQ1HqyVZGFKLOi/eEAuptkMJ7uc6CFYK+J9hI8DiRpUf6v66tW0Tf3ccSprlBN3OnvmEojqaCwidvl8TGxKw=="
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  media="screen"
/>`

For different reasons, starting from performances and network traffic, **the recommended way of using ECL is to fetch its resources for then hosting them "locally"**.

In order to ease the access to the package containing them, the main package mentioned before: `preset-ec` is also deployed in the github release page and can be downloaded from there.

Here is an example of a default HTML file using ECL:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Page title</title>
    <meta content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" name="viewport" />
    <meta content="IE=edge" http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" />
    <script>
      var cl = document.querySelector('html').classList;
      cl.remove('no-js');
      cl.add('has-js');
    </script>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="/styles/optional/ecl-reset.css"
      media="screen"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/ecl-ec.css" media="screen" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/ecl-ec-print.css" media="print" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content of your page here -->

    <script src="/scripts/ecl-ec.js"></script>
    <script>
      ECL.autoInit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This assumes your `preset-ec` filesystems is directly accessible in the root of your project, change the path according to your environment.

In this example the main ECL css and js are defined and in addition a css for print and the reset css are added.
There are also other optional css files distributed that can be used, for further information about them check below.

### moment.js

As explained in a more technical language in the [datepicker api page](/ec/components/forms/datepicker/api/) ECL uses [Pikaday](https://github.com/Pikaday/Pikaday) which requires [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and this library is not bundled by ECL.
Therefore **moment.js needs to be loaded or bundled by the application or website using ECL**, depending on the needs.

### Update file path and name

- If you wish to use ECL EU instead of ECL EC, you can find information here <Link to="/eu/getting-started/" label="Getting started EU" />
- Replace <code>[ECL_VERSION]</code> by <code>v{process.env.ECL_VERSION}</code> to use the latest version
- For more security, use the SRI hashes corresponding to the files. They all can be found in the [release page](https://github.com/ec-europa/europa-component-library/releases), in a json file, but here are the most common ones:

<details>
  <summary>SRI hashes (click to expand)</summary>

  <ul>
    <li>
      for `ecl-ec.css`: <code>{process.env.ECL_EC_CSS}</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      for `ecl-ec-print.css`: <code>{process.env.ECL_EC_PRINT_CSS}</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      for `ecl-ec.js`: <code>{process.env.ECL_EC_JS}</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

### Optional styles

There are several optional CSS files, located in `ec/styles/optional`, which can be included in your site on not, depending on the needs.  
**These optional CSS have to be called before the main ECL CSS**

- `ecl-reset.css`: contains some css reset rules, mostly based on normalize.css, with a few custom additions
- `ecl-ec-default.css`: apply ECL styling to some default HTML tags (links, buttons, table, ...). Note that this file is meant to be used in specific cases, the recommanded way to use ECL is still to add corresponding classes to HTML elements. A corresponding print css `ecl-ec-default-print` is also provided.

<details>
  <summary>SRI hashes for optional files (click to expand)</summary>

  <ul>
    <li>
      for `ecl-reset.css`: <code>{process.env.ECL_RESET_CSS}</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      for `ecl-ec-default.css`: <code>{process.env.ECL_EC_DEFAULT_CSS}</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

### Additional information

- to integrate ECL components, copy the markup from the component you want and paste it in the `<body>`. This markup can be found on this website and on <Link to="/playground/ec/" label="the playground" />.
  TWIG templates are also [provided on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/ecl) for easy integration.
- make sure that you are correctly loading the icons and the logo by using the right paths. You will usually find these assets under the `/images` folder of the preset you're using. We advise you to host the SVG sprites on the same domain as your website in order to avoid the `Unsafe attempt to load URL` kind of errors. If you still want to use the SVG sprite from the CDN, you can use [svg4everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) and itinitialize it with: `svg4everybody({ polyfill: true });`.
- before going live, make sure to embed the [Cookie Consent Kit](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/webtools/Cookie%20Consent%20Kit%20-%20Technical%20details).
- all useful information concerning releases content can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/ec-europa/europa-component-library/releases)

## JavaScript

You can either initalise JS components manually or automatically. Here, we will focus on the automatic initialisation. If you want to know more about the manual initialisation, please check the component's documentation.

In order to automatically initialize a component, add `data-ecl-auto-init="[component class]"` to the root element of the component, `[component class]` being the name of the JS class related to the component.

For example, if you want to auto initialize a `Message`:

```html
<div
  role="alert"
  class="ecl-message ecl-message--info"
  data-ecl-message
  data-ecl-auto-init="Message"
>
  ... Message component ...
</div>
```

Then, in the footer of the document (or whenever the document is ready), call `ECL.autoInit()`. For example:

```html
  <body>
    ...
    <script>
      ECL.autoInit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
